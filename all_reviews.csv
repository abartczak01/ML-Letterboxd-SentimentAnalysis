2024-06-13,A well shot film with great acting that falls a little flat bc of the length and the rather un-climactic ending  of the huge reveal that should’ve had even bigger implications when you consider the world going back to the first film. All around a great sequel.,8
2024-06-13,THIS IS CINEMA!!! 👑🗣,10
2024-06-13,why are the barcodes in the eye. WHY.,6
2022-12-17,"It's a great film, definitely a worthy follow-up to its predecessor, using both the pre-established universe and characters as a continuation rather than a stunt.",9
2024-06-13,it’s a good movie i love ryan gosling and ana de armas,6
2024-06-13,"Absolute cinema, can't top the last scene it's how I want to die",10
2024-06-13,I want every shot from this film to frame in my wall. Definitely a piece of Art.,10
2024-06-04,"If you took out the weird CGI sex scene and also MacKenzie Davis's other appearance near the end, this might've been a genuinely perfect movie.",10
2024-06-13,I to would be very attached to a hologram of ana de armas,9
2024-06-13,Inshallah in 2049 portable ana de armas hologram 🙏,7
2024-06-13,"One of the best Ridley Scott films, also one of the best of its own genre.Revolves around a postmodern narrative theme,The performances in this film are awestruck.The cgi and the visuals are absolutely mind-blowing.The movie starts off slow but intense.Yes it is the sort of film you need to see more than once to be understandable/appreciated but the story is very compelling and very deep thematically.Would’ve been an easy 5 star if it wasn’t slow but the visuals and the atmosphere top it off.",8
2024-06-13,2nd time watching it but my first time logging it. ,8
2024-06-13,"to be honest i was so completely lost, i liked it tho! wish i understood it better. i just thought it was very sad",7
2024-06-13,it's a really good movie with some cool scenes on it,9
2024-06-13,I really love how those flying cars do a little circle before landing. It's like their a golden retriever lying down on their bed.,8
2024-06-13,i could not hear well but the cinematography was excellent,7
2024-06-13,I love you Syd Mead ;-;,10
2024-06-13,This is a very fine sequel.,8
2024-06-13,"Extremely cinematic, the plot is fantastic and also depressing",9
2024-06-12,Harrison Ford is old and cranky in this movie.,9
2024-06-12,"This movie is to Blade Runner what Aliens was to Alien, a sequel that is just about the same quality while maintaining a tone that is completely different from the original. My only complaint is that Denis Villeneuve used his trademark “stretching the run time more than necessary” card and it is felt when watching the film. If the plot was a little tighter and fast-paced, Blade Runner 2049 would have been as easy 5/5. Fortunately, the slightly bloated length barely takes away from 2049 and it’s among the best sci-fi movies I’ve seen from either past or modern times.",9
2024-06-12,great retake on a older franchise,9
2024-06-12,"Beautiful film. I don't think it captures the same vibe and emotion as the first one, but Villeneuve managed to extend Scott's universe in a clever original way.Obviously, Roger Deakins' cinematography is simply the best, and combining this to amazing settings, a great soundtrack, and Ryan Gosling as the lead actor, nothing can go wrong.",9
2024-06-13,And what was his miracle? Ana de Armas or that sick-ass coat?,8
2024-06-12,Wow so sigma and relatable.,8
2024-06-12,"disappointing... story wasnt as good as the original and theres no moment that comes close to Tears in Rain. Kinda a common theme in Villenueve movies, all style no substance. the hologram gf effects were crazy tho.",6
2024-06-13,Pretty good,10
2024-06-13,ryan gosling acting autistic #92837,6
2024-06-13,Pure eye feast visuals,6
2024-06-13,🙂💫 im lowkey fan of sci fis 💫🙂,8
2024-06-12,it’s good..but nowhere near as good as the original,8
2024-06-13,Wow! What a beautiful fantastic movie that I can’t believe I watched truly beautiful in every aspect I will need to rewatch this and do a more in depth review because this movie is truly special!,9
2024-06-12,too slow,8
2024-06-12,absolutely stunning on every front,10
2024-06-13,ART. CINEMA,10
2024-06-12,Gosling looks cool as hell for almost 3 hours.,8

2024-06-12,oh so that’s where the tiktok audio’s from,8
2024-06-12,The best Denis Villeneuve movie before Dune Part 2 came out,10
2024-06-12,"Denis Villeneuve should just make all of the movies guys ngl. This was what I was wanting out of the first movie but completely realized. The visuals alone had me changing my pants for every shot (😶). The only downside was whenever Dr. Michael Morbius said ""it's morbin' time"" and Morbiused all over the place, but I guess Jared Leto had a good performance or whatever.",10
2024-06-12,I wish Ana De Armas could appear at the click of a button too,10
2024-06-12,Why everyone got bangs?I was expecting HF to turn into Han Solo.Good twisty storyline and connections to original Blade Runner.,7
2024-06-12,"I always think the Blade Runner movies plot wise are..... not great, but all the amazing cinematography makes up for it entirely, it's like candy?",8
2024-02-11,I remmeber being dead tired this night sooo there's thatBut always love gosling,8
2024-06-12,my hottest take yet: this is better than the original! and another one: denis is one of the best directors of our time!,9
2024-06-12,What is it to be human? Idrk but the movie was sick asf,7
2024-06-12,There’s a point in this movie where Harrison Ford asks Ryan Gosling if he likes whiskey and I don’t know if I’ve ever said “he’s literally me” faster,8
2024-06-13,I’m literally Officer K.,9
2024-06-12,Why is he in this,9
2024-06-12,"Somehow someway the great blade runner was surpassed by a sequel made more than two decades later. This film is more enthralling while also not being able to exist without the first one. Playing heavily into the subject matter of its predecessor, this film portrays a better love story. Great performances from all actors in the film it stays in time with the year that it was made but definitely feels like a return to the world created in the first film. I can always rewatch this film and thats saying something as it is almost three hours long.",10
2024-01-05,"i dont think i understand, but hes literally me",6
2024-05-16,I watched this movie with Luke Armstrong who told me he would drop an unlimited amount of money to get an Ana De Armas AI girlfriend to have around. He is pathetic.,10
2024-06-12,"One of the best movies I’ve seen. Story feels original while still adding to the previous premise. I won’t spoil anything, but the twists and turns feel needed to complete such a masterpiece of a story.",10
2024-06-13,I look lonley😞😞,10
2024-06-12,Is it real?,8
2024-06-12,Overrated.,7
2024-06-12,"impressive that they got Literally Me in this movie, considering that i dont remember doing any filming",8
2024-06-12,What’s it like to hold the gyatt of someone you love Sigma.You’re not even close to baseline,8
2024-06-12,better a second time#justiceforjoe,10
2024-06-12,"When I watched Blade Runner 2049 for the first time at the cinema it felt slow and somewhat emotionless.But re-watching it immediately after re-watching the original blew me away! Visually stunning, it deepens the themes of the first film and asks questions about humanity. I have never felt so much emotion from such an ambiguous film. Give it a second chance!",9
2024-06-12,"Overall a pretty mid film. Improves on some aspects that the last one was short of but still falls to many of the same flaws. Story that doesn’t feel earned, characters that are uninteresting, and goes on for way to long with many unnecessary scenes that don't do anything for the plot. Duneis Villanueva let me down with this one and not sure why these movies are as popular as they are.",6
2024-06-12,"pretty visuals, but is it just me, or does it feel unfinished? so much room to cook w this world and characters ahhhh",6
2024-06-12,Probably would prefer the book,5
2024-06-12,"A sequel that takes the best philosophical dilemmas presented in the originals and makes them even more intense and salient. The dialectic between humans and replicants is strong and moving. Is being human to have free will? What does that mean? Or is it simply to feel? Or participate in a greater cause? The cyberpunk futurism beautifully investigates what the line between human and machine while simultaneously deconstructing the messianic character trope. Like the first blade runner, the movie ends with one of the most thought-provoking and meaningful death scenes. “Dying for the right cause. It's the most human thing we can do.”",10
2024-06-12,"saw this was directed by the dune guy and thought ""oh im sure""",8
2021-01-09,I watched this movie like a looooooooooooong time ago but still remember a bit about it,9
2024-06-11,Watched it on my Ipad on a plane as Denis intended.,8
2024-06-12,"If those jawdropping gorgeous visuals were a person, I think true romance wouldn't be enough.",9
2024-06-12,“I can fix that”,10
2024-06-12,“Sometimes in order to love someone you have to be a stranger”,10
2024-06-12,"Broo it's definitely stunning!neither it's the landscape, or Joi.",10
2024-06-12,Cool,7
2024-06-12,Yk I never understood before watching this the “literally me” memes,10
2024-06-12,this movie is 3 hours long . interlinked,9
2024-06-12,He’s literally me,10
2024-06-12,need to live in this movie,10
2024-06-12,"From the visuals to the silent scenes, these movie is a masterpiece",10
2024-05-27,if an emotionally detached existential crisis was a movie,7
2024-06-12,"It may be standinf on the shoulders of a giant, but this movie is better looking and paced than the giant below it, and by recontexualising events it makes Blade Runner better for it.",10
2024-06-08,Unpopular opinion but I liked the first one more,6
2024-05-20,the story of a man who wishes to be special. fitting. i feel that way too. sometimes we lie to ourselves thinking we're achieving something big but in the end it doesnt benefit us at all. i liked this movie but i wouldnt watch it again,6
2024-06-12,better every rewatch,10
2024-06-12,This is cinema. I imagine this is what’s happening in the US while the Mad Max stuff is happening in Aus.,10
2024-06-12,"still one of the best films i've watched, watching it a 2nd time really honors the first initial viewing",9
2024-06-12,"Twas good!! The story was very interesting, although it did leave a lot of questions unanswered. I guess that’s a good thing though, leaves a lot up to interpretation. Overall, I really like this movie. The effects were cool as shit too.",8
2024-06-12,Underrated movie. I've never seen better cinematography.,9
2024-06-12,This movie feels unfinished,7
2024-06-11,pretentious robots? ... ok...?,1
2024-06-11,"Liked this much more than the first one, was way more invested in the story. The visuals and music were both really good. ",7
2024-06-11,"The world presented is dark and dreary, and the potential to perhaps change it all is at stake. Maybe. Beyond the cinematic landscape, the story wasn't compelling. Androids being able to have babies just doesn't seem revolutionary enough to change anything. It's just more beings to enslave.",6
2024-06-11,this movie I felt this movie ,8
2024-06-11,What,7
2024-06-12,“He probably got what he wanted…. To be alone.”,10
2024-06-11,still the best movie ever made,10
2024-06-11,A flawed masterpiece,10
2024-06-11,God it is still that good,10
2024-06-12,This movie was amazing omg Denis is the goat,10
2024-06-12,"Still good. Less happens in this movie than I recall last time. It's hard not to see this movie in light of 7 years of reboots and sequels, but it still stands on its own despite whatever creative morass we find ourselves in.",10
2024-06-12,"This film might have the greatest cinematography I've ever seen and I'm deeply saddened that I didn't get to experience it on the big screen, It also had great performances by the cast and a really nice score",9
2024-06-11,Villeneuve just cranks out amazing works. Easily my favorite filmmaker working regularly today.,10
2024-06-12,this movie is a masterpiece and im tired of pretending its not,10
2024-06-11,"Denis Villeneuve, the legend of Quebec-style Hollywood filmmaking, strikes again. After the two ""Dune"" masterclasses and my viewing of Scott's science-fiction classic yesterday, it was a foregone conclusion that his sequel would be seen by myself as soon as possible and I had high expectations (a modern SF master following up on a film that, in 2017, was 35 years old). In the end, despite my preference for the first opus, I have to admit that this one has more than…",9
2024-06-11,The gold standard of science fiction. I have witnessed a miracle and it is Blade Runner 2049,10
2024-06-11,I love this movie for a number of reasons.,10
2024-06-12,"Watched on a plane, between almost dozing off the movie was very confusing",6
2024-06-11,I think I like the way it looks better than the story. Like don’t get me wrong the story is okay (tbh I don’t like Ana de armis character or deckard and they got rid of Rachel who was the most interesting character),8
2024-06-11,"I wish I was a really large, blue haired naked girl...",10
2024-06-11,"This year has been disappointing so far, but at least I can rewatch this masterpiece",10

2024-06-12,I killed I'm just going to lie down for a bit,6
2024-06-11,"had some really cool shots and an interesting story but failed to do anything of substance at the end. seems like it was set up for a sequel but as it has been 7 years since release i think it was just poor writing. couldve been very good, was not.",5
2024-06-11,lowkey boring…,7
2024-06-11,"Denis said ""I'll become Ridley Scott and do it better"" and he did",9
2024-06-11,"I didn’t watch the first one which I think drastically decreased my attachment and the impact of the story, I was told I didn’t need to and was clearly lied to",8
2024-06-11,Watched it on a plane when I was 14 and had no idea what was happening. A lot better on rewatch.,8
2024-06-12,denis you’ve blown me away again,10
2024-06-11,A contender for my favorite movie ever,10
2024-06-11,"Second half collapses in on itself. Infinitely less thought provoking and entrancingly beautiful than the first. It feels almost unfair to compare the two but no sequel can ever operate in a vacuum and this suffers as a result. Cartoonishly presents its moral questions as well as Villeneuve again presenting twists with far too much hand holding. The final scene as the reveal for the identity of the replicant child would be perfect. Deakins is a god but, the art direction feels too clinical and the narrative too removed for this depiction of the universe to feel real and alive.",5
2024-06-11,Literally me movie but it’s actually good.,10
2024-06-11,Best sci-fi movie with one of the best stories of all time. And incredible acting and insane rollercoaster plot that carries this movie. If you look lonely this movie can fix that,10

2024-06-11,"Do they teach you how to feel sigma to sigma? Skibidi edge rizz. Good movie, Jared Leto jumpscare, favourite movie imo.",10
2024-06-11,Better on a second viewing but still very long,7
2024-06-12,Rewatched on the flight to Dubai and really noticed a change in how I saw the film before watching the original and then after. This is quite literally the perfect sequel as it does nothing but boost the previous film and takes absolutely nothing away from it. The only reason it isn’t a 5/5 is because I can’t personally rank it about anything in my top 10,9
2024-06-11,: I'll never pick Another One over Her.: Guess I'll be Alone Forever.,8
2024-06-11,Ryan Gosling? More like Ryan Goose this was such a mature performance by him amirite,8
2024-05-16,"Cool ,they rlly tricked me , but forgiven fire 🔥",8
2024-06-11,Watched on the tele,6
2024-06-11,maybe i should have watched the original before watching this,6
2024-06-08,lowkey kinda boring but the cinematography was fire and i love sci fi dystopia and also i love ryan gosling,6
2024-06-11,i had been meaning to revisit blade runner 2049 for ages now. apparently june is the month of incredible rewatches and this one was no exception. denis villeneuve is one of my favorite directors. this movie in particular means a lot to me because it was my very first villeneuve experience that i got to witness in theaters. i remember being completely blown away by those epic frames and by the atmosphere they created.,9
2024-06-11,"Cut in half, and the beginning is the end of the movie. Only that in the middle of the journey, nostalgia makes the movie less compromised. Loss of subtetly completed.In a way, i feel pissed off by the fact that the images of this movie trascended as a meme. How can you understand the stuff you see when everything you keep are fragments from unreal Worlds, based on the past; (that's what social media Is) worlds you don't belong…",6
2024-06-11,a bit overrated,7
2024-06-11,"watching this dubbed in German was a fever dream, german ryan gosling has no rizz",8
2024-06-11,Denis Villeneuve… oh the world builder that you are!,8
2024-06-11,if youre like me and dont like long movies then dont watch this😭😭 i kept zoning out and this took me like 3 days to finish and i understood nothing. 2 stars cause it has ryan gosling and ana de armas!! i also liked the scenery,4
2024-06-11,wait Wallace was supposed to be played by David Bowie? 😭😭,9
2024-06-11,Honestly very close to a 5. I think I need to watch this when my eyes aren’t so tied. I will say though the last 30 minutes really resonated with me somehow that I can’t explain. ,9
2024-06-11,This film is like a dream. This is CINEMA.,9
2024-06-11,Ok then,6
2024-06-11,This movie is amazing!!,10
2024-06-09,cant believe how this crafted loneliness in a dystopia in the most human form,10
2024-06-11,A legacy defining performance from Ryan Gosling that only improves upon the world Ridley Scott opened back in 1982.,9
2024-06-11,"I could match Jared Leto’s freak, also I’m definitely not a real person",9
2024-06-10,"This movie did not live up to all the hype that people give it. It was funny seeing all the “literally me” Ryan Gosling memes in the wild and the plot was an interesting concept, but the way women were portrayed in this movie kinda pissed me off considering the way men RAAAVE about this movie, and I’m glad Ryan Gosling was in Barbie to make up for it. ",5
2024-06-11,"unfortunately this wasn’t a winner for me. i waited to watch it for so long thinking i would love it and there is no denying the visuals in this film are beautiful. however it didn’t impress me as much as other films. this movie is completely void of emotion. i didn’t even feel hatred, i just felt indifference. considering sci-fi is my favorite genre and it doesn’t take much at all for me to cry, it’s surprising how little i…",5
2024-06-11,"Loved it. There were a lot of plot points unresolved, but, I don’t think resolving them was the aim. This film successfully made me weep, smile, and have anger. Characters are brilliant, and Gosling plays his role with perfect body language. Grateful for this film.",8
2024-06-08,Dennis Villneuve is obsessed with brutalist architecture and bald people.,8
2024-06-11,This was such a wonderful watch it’s always great to see a sequel that’s on par or better than the original especially with there being such a gap in between the two and having a different director for the sequel. But man I’m not to sure what to say that hasn’t been said about this film it’s a beautiful story and a wild concept with the visuals and soundtrack helping to elevate the story and the atmosphere that it encapsulates…,8
2023-08-19,"Very good movie , ( bring this man his gf back for god's sake).",10
2024-06-10,I don’t like futuristic movies. I watched this for Ryan Gosling. He didn’t really eat though. Very sad movie.,5

2024-06-11,"I missed the first hour and I was really drunk for the rest movie made no goddamn sense, suck balls",2
2024-06-11,"This movie was great but I feel like the story was slightly unnecessarily convoluted. I wasn't the biggest fan of the twists and turns of the main characters backstory. Some people could've liked it though, personal preference. The visuals are amazing as well of course but honestly I preferred the vibe of the first movie more which is kinda surprising for me to say because I dont really like old movies. Still worth a watch. These movies are like Cyberpunk 2077 if it was a live action movie.",8
2024-06-11,"Rewatch; seen it before, but lately I got a pair of SBS VR googles from a pawn shop, and decided this is the best film to test the thing. It took four hours to find the right file format and calibrate the settings, but it was worth it: this film looks beautiful in 3D, and the themes resonate well with the SBS VR experience (meaning: sitting alone is a dark room, with your phone strapped to your face, felling small and useless)",9

2024-06-11,"First Denis film. This has to be the best looking film I have ever watched, unreal frames set by the cinematographer! Great premise. I think I acted very well in this movie as Officer K. The score is amazing. So many great scenes even though it was kind of slow. K giving the horse back and dying at the end to me is... CINEMA",9
2024-06-10,"I probably should have watched the other one first, oops",9
2024-06-11,"This movie is what I mean when I say I love dystopian films. This is one of the best movies to come out of 2017 by a long shot. The shots in this movie are jaw dropping alone, then adding in the amazing cast this movie has. Overall an amazing film that I am so glad I watched.",10
2024-06-11,Not a huge sci-fy guy but this movie was very entertaining. Very psychedelic vibe going on which I loved. The plot was solid with a lot of depth.,7
2024-06-11,Greatest movie ever?,10
2024-06-10,Probably the one movie series with a sequel that’s better than the original!,9
2024-06-10,All Denis Villeneuve really wants to do is film enormous pieces of scenery and put loud music over it and I respect that,7
2022-11-22,"Atmosphere is bleak just like the original. Cinematography is dark and gritty and wonderfully executed to fully immerse you in the world. The city looks amazing. It's loud. It's busy. It's chaotic. Its reminiscent of the original, which was already so ahead of its time. That trend continues here in full form. Some of the visuals here are so trippy. Seeing the holograms glitch in and out in the scene where Ford and Gosling meet is super unnerving and it's…",7

2024-06-10,Utterly fantastic. The atmosphere is unparalleled.,10

2024-06-10,I have a train of thoughts for this one. lets dive in: ,9
2024-06-10,While I don’t have this over the original is an undeniable beautiful sequel that follows the themes and expands on the world in a way that does Justice so so well. It’s a fantastic companion piece I’m so glad I went back to,10
2024-06-11,"very great movie, watched along time ago but just rewatched, such great cinematography, phenomenal acting and great atmosphere, only downside is the film starts off very slow but picks up very quick",9
2024-06-10,gimme that emanator,9
2024-06-11,the movie is breathtaking but jared leto was a jumpscare,10
2024-06-10,I had really high expectations going into this because everyone that told me to watch this film told me it’s a 5 star masterpiece. And it appears to me that nowadays people appreciate good visuals more than a good story and I’m tired of it. We as a society have to stop pretending that a visual spectacle film is rare or something because we live in times where CGI and AI are the most powerfull they have ever been.I…,7
2024-06-11,perfect sequel one more perfect movie and we have a better trilogy then LOTR,10
2024-06-10,Shame this movie didn’t make money. ,9
2024-06-10,i need to rewatch i’m confused,5
2024-06-10,Visually stunning brain funk. Makes me question if I’m interlinked between cells,10
2024-06-11,pretty cool but too long raises some interesting questions abt human nature and what it means to be/love ,7
2024-05-23,Why was it so long?,4
2024-06-11,"The fact that this was a box office flop and yet Jumanji was a success, means people are getting dumber. No other explanation.",7
2024-06-10,"Denis. you god. this is a great continuation and the evolution of all the greatest parts of the OG is present here. also harrison jumps to conclusions again and its just, just a whole thing.",10
2024-06-11,I will admit I wasn’t paying attention for like a third of this movie,7
2024-06-02,You look lonely i can fix that,7
2024-06-10,so strikingly beautiful. i really think ryan gosling can do it all. gonna go play detroit: become human now brb,7
2024-05-03,Really sick movie. Lived up to the hype no doubt.,10
2024-06-10,Ana de armas is a rocket,9
2024-06-10,i look lonely you can fix that,8
2024-06-10,This movie's use of color is soo good,9
2024-06-10,What happened to Deckard’s dog though,9
2024-06-10,Amazing movie. Almost perfect in every way. Ryan goslings character and the mystery of the movie make it fantastic to watch.,9
2024-06-10,"Decent one time watch. Beginning is slower, but it picks up in the second half. Felt I could have watched this movie on 1.5x though, and not messed anything. Not Villeneuve's best work, but I think that's because of the screenplay/story, vs. his execution.",7
2024-06-10,"Movie is amazing, not like the original but still good.",10
2024-06-09,IMAX re-release when,9
2024-06-10,"I know it's a good movie, I was just lost for half of it",6
2024-06-10,This is a banger!,10
2024-06-09,ryan gosling's performance is so wild after the silly unserious characters he's played in the last couple years give this man more dramatic roles,10
2024-06-10,"One of the best movies i've laid my eyes on. All 3 hours are worth it and I need it to be longer, I love Ryan Gosling.",10
2024-06-10,the color choices of this movie are insane. i’m at a loss for words every time i re-watch it. just a gorgeous flick.,10
2024-06-10,"Felt like three hours of the first act, with no second or third",5
2024-06-10,han solo was good i love harrison ford not in a gay way,8
2024-06-10,"Wow, this one expanded on everything the original did, but upped the stakes, the emotions, and the mystery to a whole new level. Watching these films back to back is insanely satisfying.",9
2024-06-10,Ok I don’t know what to do with my life right now,9
2024-06-10,Enhance pt. 2,9
2024-06-10,"Don’t know why I held off on watching this, but it has definitely become one of my favorite movies. Great sequel while still having its own story and it’s about as visually perfect as it can be. Gosling has become my favorite actor",10
2024-06-10,this film is one of the best looking and best sounding I’ve ever seen.ryan gosling and ana de armas do a great job with their roles.pretty solid but not my cup of tea.3.5/5.,7
2024-06-10,"One of my absolute favorite sci-fi movies! Legacy sequels can be so hit or miss but this movie does the original justice while continuing to build out the Blade Runner world. Ryan Gosling gives one of my favorite performances in this movie as well! If you like sci-fi and haven't seen this one yet, check it out!",10
2024-06-10,"It's a no for me. I liked the visuals, but the plot felt incomplete in some way, I was bored the 70% while I was watching this. It works, but not for everybody.",4
2024-06-10,classic boy movie,7
2024-06-10,Maybe I’m really stupid but this movie confused me the first time I watched it but Ryan gosling is hot,10
2024-06-10,"not was i was expecting at ALL if u don’t know the plot don’t search up shit trying to see if you’ll like it or not, it’s fantastic. music 10 visuals 10 acting 10 plot 10 WOW this’ll kick me into sci-fi mode for a couple weeks",9
2024-06-10,the cinematography is beautiful,10
2024-06-10,"sci fi really isn’t my thing, but for a sci fi movie this was incredible. beautiful cinematography.",6
2024-06-10,"Absolutely phenomenal stuff, incredible sequel. The only actual problem with the film is that’s it’s not the original. K is a great protagonist, but he’s no Rick Deckard, Luv is a great villain, but she’s not Roy Batty. Rick Deckard is still so peak in his small role in this. Overall I love and appreciate this so much more on rewatch, but I still think the original is the far superior film. Still one of the greatest films of the century, which says everything.",10
2024-06-10,there is no way i accidentaly watched this at june 10,9
2024-06-10,Unquestionably beautiful to look at but I didn't really feel much emotion the whole time unfortunately. ,9
2024-06-10,I love dystopian fantasy’s,8
2024-04-13,"Not sure how I let this one slide for so long.Perfectly paired like fine wine to the song ""after dark"" by Mr Kitty.Mens depression.Beautiful women.Neon fututre Tokyo rain theme.But also Mars.Cinematography up the wazoo.A must watch, new, all-time classic.",9
,this isnt bladee...,8
2024-06-10,I can't state how close to perfection I think this is as an unnecessary sequel.The amount of thought that went into so many aspects of the whole film is genius and makes it a believable follow up to the first film.,9
2024-06-10,"Love the obvious influence both films had on Cyberpunk 2077. Loved the game and loved both films equally as much, hope to see the universe expand more in future instalments.",10
2024-06-10,it looks amazing! please don’t kill me story is boring :(,2
2024-06-10,"""You look like a good Joe,"" maybe the saddest line of dialogue in any movie ever. Bless you Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins, you made a masterpiece!",10
2024-06-10,"Very complicated probably should've watched the 1st movie to understand but, me no no wanna",6
2024-06-08,Breaking In the OLED with this. HOLY SHIT,10
2024-06-10,"What a masterpiece, denis you’ve done it again",9
2024-06-10,jared leto has no business being on the poster with his three seconds of screen time,9
2024-06-09,Woah,9
2024-06-10,"A piece of art! Dennis is just so good at this stuff. The world buiding, sound design/foley, casting and story all around were amazing in this. God bless Roger Deakins, the cinematography is incredible. Probably the most calm sci-fi movie I've ever seen. K deserved better...",10
2024-06-09,ana de armas was serving cunt until she tried to worship ryan gosling by naming him joe ,8
2024-06-10,What happens off-planet stays off-planet,8
2024-06-10,Movie so good I had to let it sink in on a 8 hour flight,10
2024-06-10,Thought for sure I had seen this already but 30 minutes in realized I was wrong. I enjoyed the themes as I feel like I usually do with AI stories. I think the acting was a little weak,8
2024-06-09,"Confused, probably cause I didn’t watch the first one. Didn’t care much for the story or characters tbh.",6
2024-06-10,the feeling this movie evokes is indescribable,10
2024-06-09,jared leto needs not to be in every good thing,9
2024-06-10,a great fucking movie. minus half a point for jared leto,9
,This movie makes 98% of all other sci-fi movies call it “Sir”. Plus a whole extra star for Ana de Armas.,10
2024-06-09,THE BEST FUCKING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE OF ALL TIME.,10
2024-06-09,"There is a sequence in which Ryan Gosling, one year after doing La La Land, symbolically penetrates a beehive and then plays a note on a piano. If that's not the most expensive ""Ya like Jazz?"" joke of all time, then I don't know what is.",7
2024-06-09,Way more fun to watch than the original but with less moral ambiguity,8
2024-06-02,"Outstanding atmosphere, world building, and sound design!",10
2024-06-09,Amazing!!! Dennis Villanueve is the goat!! Soundtrack amazing,9
2023-05-01,in the dystopian genre but a little too contemporary to ease past,8
2024-06-09,I was shooting blanks by the end of this one,9
2024-06-08,"Blade Runner 2049 gave me the beautiful cinematography I’ve come to expect and love from Denis Villeneuve, and while I admire a lot of the work that is done here in terms of story and acting, I feel that is just fell a little short for me (not in terms of runtime however, in which I felt it was WAY too long).",7
2024-06-09,I just personally don’t find the questions and themes these films bring up that interesting. They’re still good but honestly just did not do anything for me. Ana De Armas has my heart though.,7
2024-06-10,"It manages to be neither super interesting nor super fun for the entirety of the film.It’s like one long edging process with no payoff other than Ryan Gosling finally giving up, and lying down.",7
2024-06-09,ryan gosling needs to be studied and preserved for mastering the art of “underlying patheticness” as the next major anthropology experiment,8
2024-06-10,Awkward first date film 🍒,6
2024-06-09,watched it with lucas and jayden and like meh. ryan was cool and ana is hot but like meh yk. prolly should’ve watched the first one,6
2024-06-09,"Huge upgrade from the first one. I’m sure there are some things that are lost since I hadn’t seen that one in 5+ years, but I enjoyed the whole watch",7
2024-06-09,Blade Runner: Roundhouse Kick Edition. ,10
2024-06-09,ryan gosling and ana de aramas in one movie holy shit! Jared Leto jumpscare. very beautiful.,7
2024-06-09,"""You look lonely, i can fix that""",9
2024-06-09,Even on the small screen 🤌,10
2024-06-09,"I'm breaking my streak of strictly only rating movies I haven't seen before because i needed to add a bad review for this movie. I'm that petty. ☹️The extra half star is for all the cool cinamtic, but hallow shots. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk",5
2024-06-10,she can fix me,9
2024-06-10,Overrated,5
2024-06-09,"Best sequel ever made imo. Not just that, but my 4th favorite movie. ",10
2024-06-09,It was only okay,6
2024-06-09,has some of the best cinematography ive ever seen also i love ryan gosling,10
2024-06-10,Cheese toastie or smth idk bit of a snoozefest ngl,6
2024-06-10,perfect watch on a rainy night with my dog’s cheesy paws next to me,10
2024-06-09,I loved it.,9
2024-06-10,"10/10 cinematography, honestly one of the most visually stunning movies I’ve ever seen. They do well to further the concept from the first movie and link it all together without harming the prequel. I honestly think it was better than the first instalment and I’m hoping for a third. Time and time again I say Ryan gosling is one of the best actors of the century. The guy can act so well even when he doesn’t have to say anything. I especially love K and joi relationship.",9
2024-06-09,There is nothing I can say about this masterpiece that hasn't already been said.,10
2024-06-09,this and the dunes are ip reboot poison super bowl commercials. you watch it and say that's neat i wish they would actually make the thing for real though,4

2024-06-09,no fr i really am. this movie is so fucking good. such a mf vibe omg,10
2024-04-05,I love this movie.,10
2024-06-09,"This movie had me tearing up quite a few times, I’d recommend this movie to anyone looking for a cinematic masterpiece.",10
2022-06-30,got a little confusing to follow at points for me but overall super cool,7
2024-06-09,"Still crazy to me how they were able to pull this off so flawlessly. Seeing it on the big screen really just highlights how lucky we are to live in a time where a sequel to one of the best movies of all-time can somehow match (and to some, even exceed) its original counterpart a whole-ass 35 years later. Bonkers. What the fuck.",10
2024-06-09,"The visusls of this movie are insane but i didnt find the movie interesting, i fell asleep 4 times watching it. As i mentioned the film is technically very well made no doubt but i cant say i enjoyed it.",7
2024-06-09,Absolutely beautiful movie. Can't wait to watch it again.,9
2024-06-09,The cinematography is literally spectacular,10
2024-06-09,"Watching this after dune, this was definitely made by the guy who made dune. Visually impeccable- shoutout to roger deakins, neon colors and cyberpunk. Recently saw an interview with zendaya during the dune press cycle and she was talking about how villeneuve would say stuff like ""do some sci-fi shit"" and this movie really felt like 2h45 of do some sci-fi shit. All sleek metal and dystopian landscapes and yet more cool vehicles moving silently through the sky. Yes the…",9
2024-06-09,"My second favourite movie of all time. Such an emotionally charged and philosophically powerful story that is a million times better than its predecessor. The acting in this movie is phenomenal, Ryan Gosling kills it as K. A perfect introspect on what it means to be alive. Villeneuve truly created a master piece with this movie. Some people complain about the pacing of this film and say that some scenes like the Orphanage and Ruins of LA scene drag on…",10
2024-06-09,second half almost flopped,7
2024-06-09,I don’t know what to say,10
2024-06-09,Enjoyed this more than the last time,7
2024-06-09,"It is sad how empty this movie feels sometimes and the score annoyed me a lot - it could never catch me or was disappointing. Besides that: Loved the concept, the story, and partly the characters. The movie looks good but I watched it right after the 1982 movie and it couldn't hold up. It feels too clean in its sets, the city not dirty enough, and less like art - probably what was most disappointing.It is very worth…",7
2024-06-09,his relationship with Joi is literally me w/ c.ai,7
2024-06-09,How tf is Joi going to pick the name Joe out of all names,6

2024-06-09,"If the pace was a little faster, this would be a 10/10.8.5-9/10",9
2024-06-09,Movie is acu definition of cinematic masterpiece. When Ryan gosling poped up I was like oh is he gonna start tap dancing.,9
2024-06-09,There really should be a movie genre called ‘Ryan Gosling in LA’ …….,10
2024-06-09,"It only took me seven years to check this one off. Luckily, the anticipatory build up didn't produce completely unattainable expectations. Maybe a trite description, but I found the visuals literally stunning, having to pause at certain points to take in the setting. As I'm writing this, I feel like it's pretty cringey to create an amateur review so I'll just talk about the one subject I want to explore.",8
,Liked this one more than the first one solely bc no abuse yeah u heard me Mr FordBesides that I loved the visuals though and Ryan did a great job,10
2024-06-09,while being super cool it was also slowI didn’t understand half of it,6
2024-06-08,"This movie builds a perfect and interesting narrative off of the original that allows for the growth of the universe and its lore. The cinematography of this movie is insane and beautiful, a staple for Denis Villeneuve films. The acting is very good and the twist is interesting and well built. It is obvious a lot of care was put into this movie to make it as good as possible while still being true to Ridley Scott's original idea.",9
2024-06-09,She within on my cells till we interlink,10
2024-06-09,"To me, this was a boring movie. Maybe it’s the fact that I watched at 3 am and I couldn’t really understand what was going on half of the time. I’ll rewatch it again a time where I’m not half falling asleep.",3
2024-06-10,Better and lesser aspects compared to first. Run time felt. DD jump-scare ecksdee. Minimal set design looks great but LA doesn’t have the right feel.,9
2024-06-09,I can fix that,7
2024-06-09,my friend forced me to watch it but i couldnt get the point,4
2024-06-09,"Love this movie so so much but knocking it down half a star bc it’s a bit too long and doesn’t treat its female characters very well :)) like every woman’s purpose in this movie is to serve a man, except the Girl Boss. ",9
,"You look lonely, I can fix that.",9
2024-06-09,This was good very good gorgeous cinematography of course but fuck I feel like I was watching the first Pirates of the Caribbean again in the way that I had no fucking clue what was going on at any point in time. Very cool though I just didn’t get it really maybe that’s my own fault for not paying attention enough; it was very long and my attention span couldn’t take it sadly when I was already confused. Very tense moments were good but left me feeling hopeless which I guess was the intention,7
2024-06-08,"It's probably the most transcendent film I have ever seen in my life. Even after sleeping on it, I am so lost for words right now. ",10
2024-06-10,So greatful for the opportunity to watch this in cinema. Such an amazing experience.,10
2024-06-05,"Had high hopes of this movie. Pretty sure i focused throughout the whole movie. But I don't get the fucking lore. Why do they feel pain, why do they bleed, how are they robots/ai? I get the plot, it's good, but its just...did not hit. Love the cinematography tho. And Ana.",6
2024-06-09,Last of three movies at the Astor in one day.,8
2024-06-10,Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford comedy when??,7

2024-06-09,What a blockbuster should be,10
2024-06-09,"Complex movie, very good world building.. plot a bit confusing but very much worth the hype!!",8
2024-06-09,"I didn't expect this film to have this much going on, in terms of it's just very different visually in the first place .",8
2024-06-09,Loneliness is very scary thing,10
2024-06-09,Pro tip : watch it on 1.5x,7
2024-06-09,I definitely loved it.,10
2024-06-09,it was quite boring but cinematography BANGED,6
2024-06-09,"wow ana de armas + one of the coolest jackets, scores and some incredible cinematography",8
2024-06-09,"Good, maybe a little dragged out imo. Cinematography bangs especially as the film goes on.",7
2024-06-09,I can't rate this any higher. A beautiful movie about what it means to exist. What an unbelievable story.,10
2024-06-09,"It's kinda insane that they made a movie this good so long after the original. It's about the same in quality though, maybe a little better in my eyes.",8
2024-06-09,a better soundtrack wouldve made it a lot closer to a 5,8
2024-06-08,A cool world created with teenage boy imagination energy at times.,6
2024-06-08,hes literally me,9
2024-06-09,Epic. Love the visuals and has good plot. Was intriguing and pulled me in from the start and kept me until the end. Awesome sequel that is as good or better than the original. Would love to see a third movie or spin off.,9
2024-06-09,"This is a very weird movie for me to talk about. Because on one hand I think it does things so much better than the original, but then the original has it's own things it does so much better than this one.The pacing for one is done amazingly in the original and for this one it has maybe 30 minutes of unnecessary Jared Leto stuff, but I can actually see why Jared Letos motivation is in the movie.The…",10
2024-06-08,"Oh my god??? Somehow more Blade Runner than fucking Blade Runner. A confident pillar of aquatic lighting, misty neon, geometric interiors, chilling synth, and (remarkably) patient silences. Honestly, we love a contemplative sci-fi without macho explosions and million man wars. The art department is firing on all cylinders to expand on the original and there’s even a respectable plot this time. PKD would be shaken back to lucidity. Maybe I shouldn’t wait 7 years to watch every Hollywood blockbuster.",9
2024-06-08,"this is a movie i wish i'd watched a long time ago. though the first is gorgeous and perfect at setting its scenes, there's something about this one that is even further haunting and captivating. i'd say the first succeeds at visual storytelling on another level, but here, it's the acting that stands out, asides from harrison ford's somewhat lackluster performance at time, but it's harrison ford, so who can really be mad or surprised there.",8
2024-06-08,"One of the (many) things I adore about this film is its humanity. The world of Blade Runner is so bleak, harsh, and cruel, yet, this film carries with it an unyielding earnestness and hope. It tells us that despite all the inauthenticity in our world, it’s still possible to live an authentic life, to discover love, beauty, meaning — and that these are all things worth fighting for. God, what a movie.",10
2024-06-08,"Visually astounding, super immersive, sonically brilliant, but ultimately rather slow and boring if I’m being honest. Even on second viewing, I still stand by the fact that this film works better as a collection of breathtaking visuals and sounds than it does an engaging story. I feel like this could literally be a ninety minute movie and still pack the same punch. Ryan Gosling is arguably my favorite living actor, and even then it’s just impossible for me to get…",7
2024-06-09,Cinematography at its peak,7
2024-06-08,this movie is absolutely incredible. i cannot believe how long i let this sit on my watchlist for. this might be one of the best movies. desperately wish i could see this in the theater,10

2024-06-08,"The visuals are amazing whoever directed it COOKED, my only question is if JOI was just a simple AI or she had a soul of some sorts ?",8
2024-06-08,"Cool movie to watch, I’m not 100% sure if I could explain the plot to you but it did make me go “huh” and “hmmm” a lot. Sure is directed by the same guy who did Dune though isn’t it?",6
2024-06-08,movie called blade runner 2024 and its about me trying to hunt and kill the AI that made those joe biden minecraft videos,8
2024-06-08,you couldn’t pay me a million dollars to explain this movie,7
2024-06-08,Amazing. Every frame of this is so incredible to look at.,9

2024-06-09,Not everyone is special 😔,8
2024-06-09,"Much better than the first one, don't know how it flopped at the box office.",9
2023-09-05,"Blade Runner 2049, an impressive piece from Denis Vilneuve, a neo - noir romantic and reflecting science fiction film with visuals like no other yet in modern history.The most beautiful film of my generation thus far.",8
2024-06-08,Even Jared Leto couldn’t ruin this masterpiece,10
2024-06-08,"The original Blade Runner was a futuristic noir thriller. It did not need a sequel but maybe like another film released in 1982, Tron, the producers thought a belated sequel was required.",6
2024-06-08,"i don't know what's not to love about this movie. one of the most stunning visual experiences ever, in my opinion. wrapped in an electrifying score and supported by incredible performances - I think Ryan Reynolds is one of the best actors of our time - I said what I said, this movie is as close as it gets to perfect.",10
2024-06-08,"I normally have no interest in sci-fi movies so I originally watched this purely for ryan gosling, but oh my god I was hooked!!! so damn good and a true cinematic masterpiece🤌🏼 can’t believe I didn’t watch this sooner",8
2024-06-08,This is my preferable Blade Runner movie. It feels like a dream when watching it at night in the dark (best way to watch it) and Ryan Goslings character is so interesting and also… literally me.,10
2024-06-08,"Absolutely perfect sequel and take a fucking bow Ryan Gosling cause that performance was just incredible. From the lighting, to the sound, to the setting the entire film is just nothing short of an artistic masterpiece from Denis Villeneuve. You could take any frame from this movie and it would be a work of art with the dynamic colours he uses they look beautiful. The story hits so hard and slowly brings you along but still absolutely captivating you. After watching this is definitely a must watch for everybody and i cant believe it took me this long to see this work of art.",10

2024-06-08,Just mind-blowingly good every single time.,10
2024-06-08,A movie with an interesting concept that feels like it tries to show an aestheticized dystopian version of the future more than it actually engages with the idea of what it does mean to have excluded groups.,7
2024-06-08,@Ramonnoya if you don't see this film you can't considere yourself a cinephile ,10
2024-06-08,"Technically fantastic but it drags…. and drags some more. I find that I want to enjoy the Blade Runner movies a lot more than I actually do. The themes and ideas are great but I keep being left with a somewhat disappointing final product. I do think the world looks too clean here as well, might be a nitpick but I love the grimy smoke filled look of the previous film more. That aside, genuinely gorgeous though out with great performances and sound design.",7

2024-06-08,"Still visually stunning and amazing audio. The ultimate ending and message hits as well, but the road to get there is…long. Very long. And once you already know the answer to the film’s mysteries it’s less enticing. A truly great film should still work 100% even if you know the reveal.",7

2019-01-01,officer k is a model member of society,10
2024-06-08,Ummmm … really really good. I didn’t know there was a first one and it sent me down a rabbit hole. Post apocalyptic movies (Ik that’s more like maze runner and hunger games and what not) but the lore in these types of movies is so good. The architecture is super cool too,10

2024-06-07,"I haven’t ever seen the original (so what, sue me) and I would imagine that would only like me make this one more, but even without that, I really enjoyed it. As with all of his films, Villeneuve has some downright beautiful shots throughout the movie. Gosling is great as always and the plot has a good twist at the end.",8
2024-05-27,"Had zero idea what this was about going into it, and although I understand the plot now, I needa watch it like two more times to get all the symbolism and deeper meanings throughout the movie. ",7
2024-06-08,The movie definitely looked nice and had some great sci-fi elements but the story was so slow and the characters were so boring it made this a slog to get through.,5
2024-06-09,This work of art was a vibe,8
2024-06-08,"Finally got around to this, although it seems to have lost some of the wow factor after my 100th time seeing the same shots on just about every film fanpage out there. Moreover, I prefer the original's visuals by a mile. When the large-scale, minimalistic cinematography isn't up your alley, what's left? None of the characters manage to be quite sympathetic enough to matter, their motivations are muddled and none, to me, appear as memorable as say, Rutger Hauer or Sean Young. Still good, just feels so much less inspired.",7
2024-06-08,wtf do i even say that hasn’t already been said,8
2024-06-08,"i went into this hoping and praying for a good movie, cos i rlly didnt care for the original. and it was a better movie!! the art direction and cinematography is insane, and you can never complain with a hans zimmer score. HOWEVER i feel like i probably needed to have loved the first movie to really rate this as highly as everyone else is, because with me not being as invested in the story as others i found it…",8

2024-06-08,"2.5+ hours of aesthetic screensavers, Gosling's stoic half-acting, detective work, existentialism, a literal projection of ""love is an intangible fantasy"" theory, Deakins' godlike eye, a replicant vs. pro wrestler fight scene, brutalism; above all, an honest attempt to make a respectable sequel to a classic that never needed one. I would also pretend Ana de Armas is my girlfriend.",8

2024-06-07,slowest film ive ever watched but ryan gosling looked cool being depressed,2
2024-06-07,I've watched it a few times and concluded that it is better than the first 6 stars out of 5 (he's literally me),10
2024-06-07,Best looking movie I’ve ever seen. The cinematography is awe inspiring. Gosling is the king of “less is more.”. His performance as Officer K is minimalistic to the best degree. Another Han Zimmer soundtrack for the playlist as well. I don’t think people could have asked much more of a Blade Runner sequel.,9
2024-06-07,"Good one. I’ve only watched it because Ryan Gosling and the cinematographic style and visuals, that are stunning ✨",5

2024-06-05,"still really REALLY good. i love how much it carries a lot over from the first film thematically and conceptually. the visual style is fucking immaculate, roger deakins is fantastic. the score? a little underwhelming if i'm honest. it sounds SO hans zimmer its a bit silly. it has its moments, the final scene in the show is particularly soft but i can't say i'm head over heels for it. regardless, this really is villeneuve's masterpiece. it operates at such a higher level than any other sci-fi film from the 2010s. a genuine masterpiece.",10

2024-05-09,"Something curious happened to me with Blade Runner from 1982, I thought I would not see something as great as that film regarding this saga, and Blade Runner 2047 appeared, an epic adventure, complex in the philosophical field, well narrated and structured. I couldn't say if it is better than its predecessor, but it is a film that, like the other one, left its mark on my mind and soul, I love this film.",10

2024-06-06,This really is a very bad movie. It’s far too slow the story is completely telegraphed. It tells you what’s gonna happen and then takes half an hour minimum for the next step in the story to happen to actually happen. No one to root for; plots just dumb. Harrison Ford shows up in like hour 2 and they fight for some reason?? At no point was I intrigued by mystery or had a suspenseful moment. So completely antithetical to the original. Just really not good at all.,1

Jared Leto’s character was also completely unnecessary and he was totally irrelevant despite being the main villain of the movie.

2024-06-05,"I’ve heard great things about this movie for a while and finally got around to giving it a proper watch. Wow! It did not disappoint, and it left me wanting even more from the stellar cast in the movie.

2024-06-05,"Blade Runner 2049 stands as a mesmerizing cinematic achievement, offering a breathtaking journey into a dystopian future that captivates and enthralls from start to finish. While some of you might view it as a direct sequel to the original Blade Runner (1982), director Denis Villeneuve crafts a good narrative that stands confidently on its own, making it accessible even to those who haven't seen the first film. Overall, a good sci-fi.",8

2024-05-10,"Arguments can be made that this film is better than the original, which for the most part is true. Except for one major flaw: Jared Leto. Not only is his performance complete garbage, but the actual character is also a bit crap. If they deleted all of his scenes and just made Luv the antagonist, the film would benefit greatly and far outshine the original. But because of that one major flaw, the film has to sadly be number two.",9

I think the cinematography stands out in this movie. truly beautiful and one of those movies that give such a nice vibe. the acting was also great and I think it was overall an ok movie..

2024-06-03,"So many cool little details and world-building moments in this film, cinematography is stellar (as can always be expected from Roger Deakins), but as someone who actively loves sci fi that explores the nature of humanity, I don't know that this brought a fresh enough perspective to the table for it to fully distinguish itself.

2024-06-03,"I took a long time to watch this movie. I started it twice and gave up, and only managed to watch it on the third attempt. It's very slow, with some really boring moments. What saves this movie is the setting, with neon-dystopian urban landscapes and vast desolate areas that evoke a sense of loneliness and contemplation.This film is a visual masterpiece. Indeed, Villeneuve created a stunning atmosphere of a completely ruined future.",8

I thought my taste in films has slightly matured over the years but not enough to think this is a great film. Unpopular opinion but I do not like Ryan Gosling in this movie. I find his character and dialogue delivery so boring and un-emotion. I KNOW he's technically a robot…",4

2023-06-22,Very depressing but cinematic!!,6
2024-06-03,This is the most visually stunning film I have ever seen. It was cool as fuck and a great time but if felt the story could have had more to it. For the past 3 hours I’ve watched a lonely man walk yet I still can’t speak to women. Ana de Armas is the one.,8
2024-06-04,A visual spectacle. Denis Villeneuve showed his class with Hans Zimmer doing his usual. There were few scenes in which the actors shouted out of nowhere kind of jump scare for me. Ryan Gosling was amazing. Moreover it was a good pick up from the '82 Blade Runner. Worth watching.,10
2024-06-04,Denis you beauty.,8
2024-06-02,"Although not the masterpiece that the original was, I appreciated this sequel much more the second time. When I saw it in the theater I was focused on following the (complex) plot, but on rewatch I could focus on Villeneuve's creative visual language and landscapes. He took on the impossible task of making a sequel to a beloved sci fi classic, and managed to build on the original vision in his own way, not just mimicking the look and feel.…",7

2024-06-03,not as good as arrival. too long. for an almost 3 hour movie should be bigger,7
2024-06-03,"Watched just for being a sci-fi movie and stayed by the story, nice performance by Ryan Gosling, the photography it was amazing, the camera angles, the feeling of loneliness of the protagonist.

2024-06-03,damn bro knowing the context of the “you look lonely” making it seem not so aesthetic anymore,8
2024-06-02,Much better my 2nd go around,8
2024-06-03,Every shot from this film is insane,7
2024-06-01,Quite a pad you got here Jackie,8
2024-06-03,ryan gosling cannot be taken seriously with this face🤨 mais bon masterclass quand meme,9
2024-05-31,In-flight rewatch. For some reason I remember the final fight scene being more tedious but it's actually not that long. Maybe I've just been bored of final fight scenes.,10
2024-06-02,Fucking perfect in every way,10
2024-06-02,Do you ever dream of having your heart interlinked?,10
2024-06-02,Mid. Too many plots unsolved. Visually stunning tho.,7

2024-06-02,"In 10th grade my English teacher assigned us “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” And I’ll admit I’ve avoided Blade Runner in an effort to keep my nostalgia for the book and his class unchanged. A few years back I tried to watch the original Blade Runner and I really couldn’t get into it. I felt like it missed the true bleakness of the world the story was set in, but the sequel captured the undercurrent of disappointment and discontent…",8
2024-06-02,You really have to think hard about it when you watch the movie.,6
2024-06-02,I think I’m too stupid for this movie,7
2024-06-02,I don’t think I understand this movie. But that’s okay cause it looks nice.,8
2024-06-02,"Pretty to look at? Yes.But that's pretty much all there is to it. Same as the first one, I don't get why everybody is raving about this. I felt zero emotions other than ""Holy cannoli how much time is left?!"" the three times I paused this, and a whole bunch of ""okay this is a weird thing to put in a movie""",3
2024-06-02,"Okay y'all, after listening to the soundtrack again, my love for Zimmer has been rekindled. I realized that for the specific elements and mood that Villeneuve was going for, Zimmer really outdid himself and met the demands of this film perfectly. That's why I am now updating the music score to a 2/2. My applause to you, Hans Zimmer.Overall grade:cinematography: 2/2directing: 2/3casting: 1/1Story: 2/2Music score: 2/2",9

2018-01-16,"In Blade Runner: 2049, K (Ryan Gosling) is a new model Replicant working as a Blade Runner for the LAPD in the year 2049. His job (like all Blade Runners) is to hunt down and ""retire"" (aka exterminate) all the old model Replicants. During a routine mission, he stumbles across a long-buried secret that may just hold the potential to turn the world as they know it upside down and spark a revolution or all-out war.",9
,"He looked lonely, I don't think she could fix that.Literally Me.",10
2024-06-02,Perfect story,8
2024-06-02,it was a bit too slow for me??but honestly I wouldn't trust my own judgement because I was very sleepy while watching this and i know i should've just slept but what you gonna do about it?,4
2024-06-02,pretty sick. fuck with the aesthetics,7
2024-06-02,I was so into it then I fell asleep and got lost :/ will try to rewatch,7
2024-06-02,Unbelievable. Denis never does anything half assed. Every scene has extra thought and innovation. What a treat,9
2024-06-02,"I had high expectations and I wasn't disappointed. This film has stunning visuals and a phenomenal soundtrack. However, the 1982 original is a flawless masterpiece for me. It's much rawer, dirtier, and grittier. The sequel looks, at times, a little bit too clean and feels too long, especially at the end. Jared Leto as the villain doesn't feel like a real threat.",9
,"i LOVE this movie, a LOVE Dennis Villeneuve, i LOVE Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas. when i first saw it, i already knew that I'll be watching it again and again with no desire to stop. it's amazing, there's nothing to say.every single screenshot you'll do will look like a piece of art. plot is heartbreaking btw, if ya even care (i know that officer k is hot and it doesn't matter what's going on with him)don't wanna spoiler more, go watch it yourself, it's pure art",10
2024-06-02,"What a film to put the new 4K TV to the test. Several times I caught myself just staring, completely slack jawed. What an entrancing movie.",10
2024-06-02,"Loved it, the pacing and all was great, I did have a problem understanding what was going on in particular scenes but I ended up understanding in dialogue from other scenes.",8
2024-06-02,"Villanious's best, in my opinion.",10
2024-06-02,This rules,8
2024-05-28,"I felt an odd comfort from this movie. Seems like something dad would definitely watch, yet he didn’t.",9
2024-06-02,"at times the lore and world building felt too dense for a narrative that ultimately leads to a very simple (but beautiful) end, but maybe i’d love it more on a second or third watch!",8
2020-11-19,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is a remarkable achievement in science fiction cinema. It honors the legacy of its predecessor while standing on its own as a profound and visually mesmerizing film. Though its slow pacing may not appeal to everyone, those who appreciate deep, contemplative storytelling will find it a rewarding and unforgettable experience.",10
2018-07-01,"i feel very attached to K, i think his deep sense of loneliness is what causes that. anyways, the visuals are stunning and it's a beautiful film. i will never shut up about this :)",8
2024-06-02,but boring at first but class movie,9
2024-06-02,one by one all of my family members abandoned me during the run time… started with 4 ended with 1. i am a solo act,10
2024-06-02,One of those movies that I’d like 100x more if men didn’t sigma-fy it,9
2024-06-02,some people might find this movie boring but like... its so good in its slowness. Ryan gosling gave a really good performance and its a shame that he's no longer going to be acting darker roles😪. but its a really good movie if you're okay with something slower paced.,10
2024-01-01,Music [4] • Cinematography [5] • Story [4] • Impact [4],9
2024-06-01,"Another movie I’ll endlessly beat myself over the head for not watching upon release. Denis Villeneuve, the current king of sci-fi, can do no wrong. I never want to leave this rainy, dystopian cyberpunk city drenched in Hans Zimmer’s otherworldly score.",10
2024-06-02,"This movie just felt like I was watching it all play out from stop to finish without a single cut. They took their time and never rushed anything, and it was so good for it. Plus, the visuals were breathtaking and the story had a beauty to it. It was like this movie was meant to be action filled, but it truly was just a lofi aesthetic dystopia that I ate up",10
2024-06-02,Ronin as a movie,8
2024-06-02,"I actually really enjoyed this film, just as much as the first one. If I had to choose between Blade Runner 2049, and Blade Runner, I really wouldn’t want to because I genuinely love them both the same, which is why they’re going to be together in my favourite films list. ",10
2024-06-02,one of the best 👌🏼,10
2024-06-02,great movie! now questioning my own humanity and what truly makes us human and what the collapse of our society will look like,8
2024-06-02,This was amazing and a very needed watch to distract myself from the lost final 🖤💛💔,9
2024-06-02,Bruh why did he not just check his eye for a serial number,6
2024-06-02,What a Masterpiece!,10
2024-06-02,Back on my bullshit.,9
2024-06-03,"A sequel on par with the first. Similar to the original, its dark, noir uniqueness, is incredibly well executed by Villeneuve, with perhaps the best cinematography in cinema history from Deakins. A fascinating plot is occasionally too slow or bleak, but is deep, emotive, and thrilling.",9
2024-06-02,I love the whole cyberpunk aesthetic in the film. Very good plot but little bit confusing at times. Still thing that it could be better. Directing and special effects were amazing.,8
2024-06-02,It's fantastic ,8
2024-06-01,I feel like this movie is more of an art piece tbh. Like this film was GORGEOUS and any moment could be printed and framed at a museum. Buttt the pacing and story fell flat to me 🫣,6
2024-06-02,"This film inspired me to make a letterbox account. Oh my god it was so good I loved it, I watched it with a couple of friends and remembered being so grumpy I had to watch a movie but damn, it seriously was so good. Everything about this movie feels so great, everything moves fluidly, the music is stunning, the cinematography is out of this world, and the plot comes together well.",9
2024-06-02,"Could have been 30-45 minutes shorter, also I really don’t like Jared Leto",7
2024-06-02,every single shot in this film is a cinematic masterpiece and no one can convince me otherwise,9
2024-03-16,good movie but i should not have watched this on a plane lmao,7
2024-06-02,This is the best film I have literally ever seen. WHY DOES IT HAVE ONLY 88% ROTTEN TOMATOES?!? IT NEEDS 110% ROTTEN TOMATOES!!!,10
2024-06-02,"The style, The feeling, The tone, The content. This movie was a revolution in itself. Blade Runner is such an interesting futuristic storyline about connection. Everything about this movie felt real. Even Joi. I have been anticipating being able to sit and watch this film. The colours and atmosphere were engaging. Couldn’t ask for much more than that.",10
2024-06-01,First one in the den.,8
2024-06-02,"Really pretty, need to watch a youtube summary for this one.",7
,Took one of my favorite films and made it just as charming and awe striking,10
2023-04-07,I can only describe this film as delicious,10
2024-06-01,"Blade Runner crawled so 2049 could fly. Seriously, the difference between these two movies is astounding. Between a plot that’s actually coherent and themes that are genuinely explored, Blade Runner 2049 sits alongside Top Gun: Maverick on the very short list of actually good legacy sequels. This delivers on what the original tried to, exploring questions core to the human experience. Questions that are increasingly relevant in the increasingly technologically complex world we live in. If something believes it’s alive, does that…",9
2024-06-02,just 2hrs and 44 mins of denis villeneuve flexing his perfect cinematography skills.,8
2024-06-01,"Amazing movie holy shit! Dennis Villneuve directed the shit out of the movie. Last shot of K  on the stairs was so beautiful, the way the camera followed him as he lays down about to die…The futuristic affect of the entire movie, except for the obvious shots where civilization was non existent were just fantastic. Also I just love the fact that the movie portrayed AI and the possibility of it reaching conscious and the ability to procreate in a…",9
2024-06-01,rewatching bc of all the new ai stuff now it’s kind of scaring me,10
2024-06-02,this movie is a blessing and y’all ignore it,10
2024-06-02,i edge to this movie. jared leto ruined it tho.,10
2024-06-01,so many deep meanings and things to think about. pretty movie too.,9
2023-07-30,Perfect sequel. Villeneuve captures eveything i love about the first film and the sci-fi genre in general,10

2024-06-02,This was lots of fun and the characters were pretty rad. Like Luv is so cvnty and I really liked Joe's Hatsune Miku hologram waifu,8
2024-06-02,Best movie I wouldn’t recommend to others. Amazing world and atmosphere.,8
2024-06-01,Dark sci-fi vibes were good but felt empty. Lots of good visuals but missing something. Very slow paced and drawn out scenes. No build up to something epic. Story felt shallow. Jared leto sucked. Love story went no where.,6
2024-06-01,Could never catch me simping this hard.,9
2024-06-01,I actually can’t put into words how I feel about this movie. Maybe in a future rewatch I’ll be able to explain it <3,10
2024-06-01,Lighting is amazing. The set design I would've loved if it weren't for the fact that its competing with the first blade runner which has even better set design. I think I liked the style of the first blade runner better but the story of this one more but they are both amazing movies.,10
2024-06-01,To be born is to have a soul I guess.Dreadfully distinct. Dark.,10

2023-03-27,"The visuals and sound are amazing, but overall, my thoughts would be the same as in the original, where the premise is boring. No hate, because, as I said, I do recognize it's an amazing film, just not my cup of tea exactly.",8
2024-06-01,"There’s so much I could say about this movie but it’s definitely one of the best sequels ever made, improves upon the original in every possible way, and cements Denis Villenueve as one of our greatest filmmakers. I loved this.",10
2024-06-01,she be running on my blade till I wanna be real for you,10
2024-06-02,for a movie this obsessed with gender politics it ultimately has fuck all to say about gender politics,5
2024-06-02,"Villenueve is an absolute master. An incredible sequel with incredible visuals, nuanced storytelling, engrossing, spectacular and full of great performances.",8
2024-06-01,Overrated tbh.,6
2024-06-01,"Just watched for the first time, and it was a gorgeous film. Every shot was carefully and artfully constructed, and Ryan Gosling gave a brilliant performance. The world created by Scott is beautiful carried on by Villeneuve.",10
2024-06-02,"1. Denis is the master of both color theory and lighting.2. It's one of the best looking movies ever, pretty much new wallpaper every minute, that's actually nuts. The scene with Presley's hologram is so well choreographed, especially the cutting sound.3. Btw sound design and soundtrack are chest-trembling, I love it. A lot of completely silent/very quiet shots only enhance that feeling when the bass suddenly kicks in.4. Holy editing, my god. That transition from burning sparks…",10
2024-06-02,God he's just so me Love it Banging,8

2024-02-14,"Impressively realistic CGI, only to be complimented by the absolutely amazing acting by Ryan Gosling and the rest of the cast. Everything you would want in a sci-fi action movie, with multiple hidden meanings and easter eggs to go with it.",10
2024-06-01,CARAMBA,10
2024-06-01,"This movie is so great, not even Jared Leto managed to fuck it up.",10
2024-05-31,"It's amazing how this movie is still a masterpiece. It's the kind of film that no matter how many times you watch it, it remains just as impactful. Villeneuve, I get why you say this is the weakest film of your career, but seriously, stop! You're wrong.",10
2024-06-01,"still beautiful, nice to rewatch after considering his style in the dunes - really such an artist",9
2024-05-31,"I really can’t stop thinking about this one, Ryan Gosling’s face truly conveys a million emotions. Obviously a visual masterpiece, but also brings a new direction to this depressive world. Not all of it worked for me on this watch, I thought some of the Jared Leto stuff and even a bit of Deckard’s scene weighed it down but this is still one of the best blockbusters of that decade.9/10",9
2024-06-01,You know it's good when they really only hit you with the message like 20 seconds before the film ends and it feels like you've had the entire film to contemplate it.,9
2024-06-01,Take heed Hollywood. THIS is how you do a sequel! I love you Denis 🫶,9
2024-06-02,literally one of the greatest movies of all time,10
2024-06-01,"starting the month off with a rewatch since I havent seen this one in a good couple years, when i first saw it, it was 5 stars as far as i was concerned though this time I had to bring it down a half star because it just didnt work as well for me this time, still the same great movie though.",9
2024-06-01,-.5 for the slow pacing but other than that the cinematography firstly 1000000000/10 genuinely any clip of this movie could be a piece of art and the story was so much more understandable to me and enjoyable than the og blade runner also the amount of screen time ryan gosling got is the only reason i could sit through 2 hours and 40 mins also when he said “to be born is to have a soul” iconic and led him…,9
2024-06-01,"A PERFECT sequel that stands tall on its own. Every time I am reminded that this was a box office bomb, I reminded how I was there opening weekend in IMAX with only a handful of people in attendance. I know this franchise may not sound like it's for everyone. I promise you this gives you the ultimate theatergoing experience that proves why you should still go to the movies like this. ",10
2024-06-01,"This is only my second time watching Blade Runner 2049 and I'd only seen it years ago, but man is this such a great film that is easily among the finest blockbusters of the 21st century. Honestly, this might still be my favourite of Denis Villeneuve's movies I've seen since it's as technically stunning as his Dune films but also has a story that is as sublime as his efforts outside of the science-fiction genre. Everything in this is just…",10
2024-06-01,There is a lot to process with this,7
2024-06-01,"This was a ton of fun, I loved the atmosphere and again you can really feel the creativity and passion oozing off of this. The actual search for the child was pretty fun too, I rlly liked where the story went and had me rlly engaged. Ryan Gosling was great, Ana De Armas was interesting, Harrison Ford actually gave a shit, Sylvia Hoeks was great and I only had to look at Jared Leto for like 2 scenes so that was a plus. Overall rlly great",9

2024-05-31,"I’m convinced Denis Villenueve makes his films for higher life forms. The same goes for Hans Zimmer and his music. This film is beyond beautiful, it’s awesome in the archaic sense of the word.

2024-05-31,"Blade Runner 2049 does so many things the right way. From the cast line up, videography, lighting, to the sound design; Blade Runner 2049 excels in all categories.The story is a continuation of Ridley Scott’s 1982 Blade Runner and picks up some slack the original may have left. It also has Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas so what more can you ask for? Although the original is a great film; it didn’t have Ryan Gosling so that’s where it fell short, but I believe this second entry took everything great from the first film and amped it up. 4.5/5: Pleasant amount of Ryan Gosling",9

2024-05-31,It was a movie i could recommend to some people. Not an amazing movie just a good watch in general. The story was good but I’m not sure how to feel about the end. If you ask me there were some unnecessary nudity. I also think that instead of kd6 - 3.7 and what not to joe it could have been to Ken and he could have just been Ken but anywhere else he’d be a kd6+4. But anyway good camera work and cgi. It has Cool concept that was executed well.,8
2024-05-31,Denis Villeneuve just gets sci-fi! World building is just insane and the atmosphere is hauntingly beautiful! We know Ryan Gosling has charisma but they really nailed the casting with 'guy that feels new things for the first time but conceals it perfectly'! Just love love LOVE this!!!!!,10

Hearing the Denis effect of hearing no sound whatsoever and suddenly there being screams or explosions is so satisfying. Like hearing Ryan Gosling screaming GODDAMN IT at the top of his lungs was amazing. Hearing the echoes…",10

Performances from everyone are pretty good especially the actress who plays Luv I think she's great. Who's no great however, is fucking Jared Leto. He ruins goddamn everything. I always sigh in disappointment when he walks on screens and starts talking bollocks. This film works so well with it's very minimal script, that story is…",9

Half off though cause i had to see jared leto, i hate that man.",9

,Blade Runner 2049 is a visual masterpiece. Everything just seems so small infront of the genius cinematography of this beautiful film. Each and every shot is implemented in a mind-blowing way. There are many great films with awesome cinematography but Blade Runner 2049 wins them all.

2024-05-30,"Beautifully builds up on the original while having its own voice and feel. Following K as he longs for more is such a natural progression to Replicants coming from their original want of their potential to be explored. K starts off as almost robotic in his mannerisms, but very clearly following a routine set for him. As time passes he shows more emotions, before finally accepting his purpose all together. Great parallel to Deckard as you can tell K shows…",8

Mr. Gosling, Mr. Dark n Stormy, this was a role you were born to play. Production, cinematography, score… your combination is a drug of its own, and absolutely an enhancer of others. What a film.",10
2024-05-30,"Do I think this sequel is better than the original BR from 1982? Yeah, I enjoyed it a bit more and found it to have a better overall structure. One pro I can give it beyond the many praises people have given this movie is that I’m infinitely more interested in K as a character compared to Deckard.

2024-05-30,Amazing movie with an amazing cast. The story is awesome and Ryan Gosling crushes his role as K/Joe. What could’ve made this movie a 5/5 is if I watched the original blade runner prior which would’ve helped with some knowledge going into it but instead I had to kind of piece things together which wasn’t really hard to do so I think this movie fucks and would definitely recommend and watch again,9

2024-05-29,"Had to revisit this one after introducing my partner to the first film recently. I was terrifically nervous leading up to the theatrical release of this, given my love of the original film. But this movie, the first of Villeneuve’s that I had seen, absolutely lives up to the pedigree of the original, and in some ways surpasses it. This is a gentle and thoughtful film, that truly invites the viewer to consider what it means to be human, and to give the audience room to apply their own interpretations. The film only suffers from some excessively grim scenery-chewing from Jared Leto.",10

2024-05-29,I need to watch this again. I’ve tried watching it a couple times now and this was the first time I got through it in one sitting. It’s too slow for me and I had never seen the first one so a lot of the importance was lost to me. After reading about it some I think I will enjoy it a lot more with another watch.,8

2024-05-29,"When I thought no one could compare to Harrison Ford in the original, Ryan Gosling proved me wrong. Almost as good as the original, and it gives off cyberpunk vibes which make you wish the game was something like this movie.",8

2024-05-30,"Aight, I know I've given 3 movies a 5 star rating in a row, but you have to be KIDDING ME with this thing, man. Unreal. I'm speechless. I think this is better than the first Blade Runner somehow, and although I really love Dune: Part Two, I also think this might be my favourite Denis Villeneuve film so far. Speaking of which, the pacing of this man's movies terrifies me deeply. I swear the pacing is so perfect it…",10

2024-05-29,"Just like the first movie, this is thematically and aesthetically way more interesting than storywise. The cinematography is obviously breathtaking, though its clinical approach lacks some of the first movie’s tangibility and grittiness. Agent K is honestly more interesting than Rick Deckard and revealing early on that he is a replicant provides a lot of new themes to explore, which the movie does beautifully. I just always feel like the main mystery is a little convoluted and not that interesting,…",7

2024-05-29,Adroit cinematography on precious IP. You live in the film for the first hour and then the intrigue kicks in.,8
,"This is my second, maybe favorite film of all time. Denis Villeneuve never misses, but this was a hard hitter. The expectations were incredibly high for me, seeing that the first Blade Runner film is my most favorite and a master class in set design, action, story-telling, thematic score, and world building. This sequel enriched the first movie, adding to the complexity of this dystopian world by giving the viewer the chance to see the other side of things from Deckard’s…",10

All in all, another incredible piece of work from this franchise.",10

2024-05-29,"Truly, the epitome of why every film bro needs to ridiculously humbled and brought down a peg. I feel like this movie is only popular because of the circle jerk of movie “critics” who saw holo-girl tits and decided that this is the future of cinema. The visuals were mid (for a sci-fi), the plot was mid, everything was mid. The world and themes of blade runner 2049 have been explored already and more importantly explored better in its predecessor. Don’t waste your time with this, go watch paint dry on a wall or something.",4

Felt really nice to see the cinematography really engross the moods of the characters using dramatic colours. The ending was bitter but that felt like the point of the movie: that melancholic awareness, the nihilistic realization of being another character in a desolate world. It really felt like Ryan Gosling's character arc was complete, and the movie understood…",10

I thought the movie was great but it’s not like the best movie ever PERFECT!, you know?

2024-05-28,"One of those films that pulls you in with its visuals and makes you never want to leave. The pure vibes this movie emanates from Gosling’s performance, his relationship with De Armas, and the beautiful art that this VFX team created are alone enough to watch this film. But on top of that, it is masterfully written to subvert your expectations and give you one of the best, if not the best crime/mystery films. I desperately wish I had seen this…",10

Especially in the rooftop scene near the beginning — there's something incredibly wrong about what I'm seeing right now. Obviously the fact that she's not human in the story is a reason but even just visually. They really mastered the idea of a computer entirely created to fill the void of male loneliness with puddle-deep, constant affection but nothing human underneath. All this in 2017; way before the OpenAI nightmare made it something we could all see daily on our timeline. Deeply heartbreaking movie. I could talk about it forever...",10

Unfortunately it soon shifts gears into a straight up sequel and it looses me slightly, it became a little too slow and bogged down. That being said, I’d still consider it one of 2017’s greatest achievements.",7
2017-10-05,Like the original film it takes a couple of viewings for the plot to truly click. But that isn't bad thing though because 2049 is equally impressive in it's Visual Effects and Cinematography.,9

2017-10-06,"Following the logical conclusion from the first film's central theme, the second film itself is a miraculous product of human sensitivity and the height of digital art. Villeneuve pushes the audience's attention span, inviting them to empathise and, in true tribute, keeps the curiosity alive.",8

2017-10-05,Breathtaking.,9
2017-10-05,"Knowing my history with the original, the thing that surprised me most was how much of a Denis Villeneuve film it was. The man is the best we have working right now",8
2017-10-05,Happy Birthday to me!,9
2017-10-05,Happy to report that it is as slow burn to death as the original and not action packed as the trailers suggested. In fact there was probably only one big action scene which is the climax but that too wasn’t some big extravagant. Oohh and there’s sooooo much to love. I need a rewatch stat!,8
2017-10-09,Visually breathtaking and fantastic sound design.,10
2017-10-05,"I'm so glad I knew close to nothing about the plot before watching this. It was so visually stunning, the sound design was so perfect too some of the best in any film recently. The soundtrack was loud and harsh which was so very needed for the landscape portrayed in the film. Also it didn't feel at all like is was 2hrs 40m typically films I watch with that runtime it feels like a chore but this finished and I felt like it's only been an hour and a half. Perfect.",10

2017-10-05,"In the new light cast by this film about life, the original becomes a film about death. The two films fold very satisfyingly together and Deckard isn't ill used to dandify new product, the way Han Solo left a slight hollow feeling, on resurrection.

First up, I have to say I love the original from Ridley Scott. It's a masterpiece of a film. Especially the final cut which is what 2049 is a follow up to. So, let me tell you straight up, if you hated the original, if you hate slow films, if…",10

It weighs in at nearly three hours with a very meandering pace, but this gives you plenty of time to immerse yourself in this future world, beautifully portrayed on the big screen in glorious 3D. The visuals and art direction are amazing as is Composer Hans Zimmer’s soundtrack which evokes Vangelis at every turn. Gosling does well carrying the burden of this sequel and to…",8
2017-10-05,"Similar to ""Dunkirk"" earlier this year, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a superior auditory and visual experience that demands to be seen in IMAX. It's a rare sequel that's not only a superior film, but adds content and context to its predecessor -- making it a better film in the process. ",9
2017-10-05,"As I was never wowed by the original, I found this to be a step up. It takes things a bit too slow, with the twists in the investigation too obvious to keep the weight of the runtime on its own. However, when every frame is as gorgeous as this it's easy to forgive those flaws.",7
2017-10-05,Definitely going to need a second viewing to work out how I feel about this... any chance I can get the version without Hans Zimmer’s score?,8

2017-10-03,"The sequel to BLADE RUNNER has some big shoes to fill. Three decades after Ridley Scott's futuristic noir redefined the sci-fi genre in 1982, director Denis Villeneuve tackles the same unanswerable questions in a film that stands its own ground from the original.

2017-10-05,Just came out of the theater and i really can't go in depth about it now. It's too fresh and i feel my appreciation on this sequel will inevitably increase or decrease significantly upon a repeat viewing. So just a couple of thoughts and immediate reactions:,7
2017-10-05,"Denis Villeneuve has directed six movies since 2010 and still he manages to make each one stand out in its own right, this one being no exception. Not only does Blade Runner 2049 improve upon its predecessor, but it connects with it on a level that's more about immersive worldbuilding than cheap nostalgia. This is not a perfect film - Jared Leto is little more than the man in the shadows and so his entire plotline doesn't really go anywhere…",9
2017-10-05,"First Bladerunner was made from scratch. And this is why it was a game changer. This one was made after hundreds of imitations, “inspired by” and blatant rip-offs. Good on it’s own right. Better than most. But it left me completely cold. Almost everything about it. One more thing: stop making prequels and sequels to the classic movies. They’re useless and forgettable.The third star is for my favorite character- the dog and his final shot.",6
2017-10-05,"A slow burn, but the fire burns strong. Beautiful film that cements Villeneuve as the real deal.",9
2017-10-05,"I’m standing here at this tram stop, completely and utterly overwhelmed by this. A speechless rendering euphoria, induced by a colossal machine of filmmaking on every level.   ",10
2017-10-05,"I can't remember the last time a film stunned me into silence on the way home. Admittedly I was by myself - so talking out loud about the weather and what I'm having for dinner would have been a bit weird - but my mind was still buzzing with thoughts and emotions from the last 163 minutes I'd witnessed, that before I knew it I was home and didn't remember the journey. Good job I didn't get run over.",10
2017-10-05,"Denis Villeneuve proves himself once again as a fucking master of sci-fi. He is, in my opinion, the best mainstream director working right now that understands sound, color, visual tension and relief, and the importance of atmospheric quiet. ",10
2017-10-05,"Amazing Score, amazing cinematography, but it's blunt, like the original. Villeneuves approach goes deeper down the rabbit hole than the first one and takes it into modern cinema, that's a plus but I feel like something is missing even though I enjoy the cinematography a lot.",8
2017-10-03,"Blade Runner 2049 opens to limited screens tonight, nationwide tomorrow, and expectations are high. Borrowing heavily from the original's approach to storytelling, along with the visual, auditory, and narrative styles of the original, 2049 takes them and extends them in natural ways that arouse new philosophical questions of life, the soul, and purpose. But it isn't perfect. ",8
2017-10-05,"Most sequels fall into the trap of trying to replicate the magic of the first. Blade Runner 2049 is totally different to the first. It is more expansive but just as thought-provoking. The film doesn't have the neo-noir sci-fi aesthetic of the first. Where there is a broad use of colour 2049 feels more distraught in its landscapes. Earth is a husk of what it once was. Go in blind, and watch this magnificent beauty.",10
2017-10-05,"My biggest struggle thinking up on this review was whether to give it 4,5 stars or 5. 5 would be fitting for my enjoyment of it but it has some flaws that ended up chipping out that half star.",9
2017-10-05,Some thoughts:,7
2017-10-05,I don't get it. Simple as. It's beautiful brilliantly acted film but simply put i just don't get it. Someone needs to explain why this is 5 stars because i don't see it at all.,8
2017-10-02,"CGI rendering has rarely looked so effortless. In the sequel to Blade Runner, it’s damn near flawless. Too often films that rely on CGI let themselves down with poor rendering despite having immense budgets and some of the industry’s brightest minds working on the projects. Low standards will always rear their head in the end. Yet, as astonishing as the CGI is in Blade Runner 2049, it's hard not to question how long sci-fi cinema will remain stuck in this…",7
2017-10-03,"Like the marginalized replicants thrust into its dreary, dystopian world, Blade Runner 2049 shoulders a burdensome, existential weight. The sequel to Ridley Scott’s seminal cyberpunk masterpiece has a daunting legacy to uphold, and the laudable effort made to contribute to that legacy is worth mentioning upfront. Beyond that, the less you know about this film—and the more you know about the original—the better positioned you’ll be to appreciate director Denis Villeneuve’s formidable attempt at an impossible sequel. So, to borrow…",8
2017-10-05,"The credits are still rolling and I've given this 4 1/2 stars. We'll see where my feelings are upon some time to reflect on the film. But I'd wager I'll be thinking about this movie for a long, long time. ",9

,"Since this movie was announced, I've been hearing ""why do we need a sequel to Blade Runner""? Well, film purists and fans of the original might still be against this movie after they've seen it, but for me it's enough to say that Villeneuve and his crew crafted this amazing movie with the uttermost respect for Ridley Scott's original work, with great drive and ambition. BR2049 is grim and slow, never afraid to take it's time but it also envolves…",9

But Fancher's script is too exiguous to buttress all of 160 mins. So 2049 wallows in fabricated gloom until...bam! Enter Harrison Ford, grumpier than ever!

That seems like an odd thing to say about a film that is 2 hours and 40 minutes long but Dennis Villeneuve has so successfully extended this fascinating world's history and mythology, all the while populating it with great new characters, that I could have basked in it for an hour longer. As it stands, this is big budget science fiction packed with intellect, mystery and still-amazing visuals rendered by legendary DoP Roger Deakins.",8

Unfortunately, admiration for this semi-spinoff/semi-sequel, for the most part, also ends with its world.

I do find this movie better than the first film, but it also suffers from the biggest drawback of the original, which is slow pacing. When a movie is almost 3 hours long, it can't be this slow.

More thoughts forthcoming when I see it again later this weekend.",9
,"A decent companion piece to the original film, but pales to the original. ""More human than human"" in name only. The film at some parts is just downright lifeless, and self indulgent. It's great to return the world that Ridley Scott created but if the film has nothing really monumental to add to the universe why come back at all. There are abandoned plot lines, and obvious red herrings throughout that just sort of had me easily detecting it like a Voight-Kampff machine. It's a fine film but that's all it really is fine.",7
2017-10-06,"Villeneuve delivers on a stunning visual experience, but ultimately the story isn’t willing to go anywhere near as far as the original was willing to go, and the main focal point of the story didn’t work as well. Plus Gosling is still too wooden of an actor to be leading man material. Replicants were designed to emulate human emotions, not act like soulless automatons. At this point I’m wondering if Gosling himself can emulate human emotions. Someone give him the Voight-Kampff test.",7
2017-10-06,Roger Deakins continues to prove he is one of the greatest cinematographers of all time. Zimmer's score pushes the pinnacle moments to new heights. Is a film about non humans feeling human emotions more human than even humans suppose to feel this way? I think so. For every question answered it seems there's a new one introduced but if that means another sequel that looks this damn gorgeous I'm fine by that.,7

Ryan Gosling gives an excellent understated performance as K. The movie builds on the lore established in the original and weaves an organic story that doesn’t feel forced at all. Overall, Blade Runner 2049 is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made and, in this critic’s opinion, undoubtedly of the best film of 2017.",10

In what sort of 'better future""…",8
2017-10-06,"Well fuck. Firstly I gotta say I accidentally saw this in 3D and despite that the visuals were still incredible. I don't think I fully comprehend this yet, and I would like to see it again to explore it more. The world building and the atmosphere and the score were nothing short of incredible. The message I feel....mixed about? The ending didn't feel book-ended to me, but it also felt right. I'm not in love but I'm awestruck.",8
2017-10-05,"A synthesized score emanates as the camera pans over a dystopian, labyrinthine Los Angeles—a city wanton with distressed beauty. The rain-slick streets sigh in their neon glow and the giant holographic advertisements scrape the grey skies. A lone man’s coat billows as he stalks through the streets, his blaster at the ready.

2017-10-06,"Amazingly beautiful visuals by Roger Deakins and mesmerizing real sets. Fantastic score by Hans Zimmer and sound design. An atmospheric, thrilling and really good story and honestly way better then the Original. Denis Villeneuve has done it again !",9
2017-10-06,"You can't tell from the poster, but there are more principal roles for women than men in Blade Runner 2049. Yet the story is centered on the actions of two Very Serious men while the female characters are treated more disposably. Their types are flatter: dead-in-childbirth mother, prostitute, girlfriend, terminatrix, ""Robin Wright-type-character"" ",8
2017-10-06,"#BladeRunner2049 is a great sci-fi film and finally a good story on the big screen again, without any mystery though. A story that incredibly well continues the original. Still the experience is so much less than in Blade Runner from 1982 mainly due to complete lack of style and soul.",8

2017-10-05,"This movie is something special. Much like the original, I can't quite grasp what it is yet, but I know that with future rewatches its layers will open up to me. One of the best films of the year for sure and a work of art. I just want to dive right back in and explore it!",8

2017-10-05,"Denis Villeneuve is arguably one the finest directors in modern cinema, but even by his standards, taking on the sci-fi goliath Bladerunner was always going to be more than a challenge. Can 2049 live-up to the expectations and reverence that fans hold so dearly?",10
2017-10-05,"Damn awesome masterpiece. It's so easy to make a bad sequel, but Dennis did his job absolutely perfectly. I'm still living in the universe of the movie, listening to its sounds, revisit the scenes and the dialogues. Thanks to everyone who was involved in doing it!",10

2017-10-06,Things that are guaranteed facts (at least to me anyway) 1. Rodger Deakins is going to win his well deserved first Academy Award because...duh! 2. Ryan Gosling is one of the best actors of this generation. 3. Movies that are this good tend to make me well all warm inside,10
2017-10-06,"I really dislike Denis Villeneuve's movies. They are very deceitful: stylish, polished, deliberate, but with no soul, no emotional substance, and ultimately with little to say beyond token expressions like ""it's morally grey"" (Sicario). 2049 is no different. It revels in bleak nihilism and its ""serious"" technique, which Villenueve interprets to just be never cutting and holding on superfluous but stylish shots FOREVER. Didn't the original Blade Runner run through just as many philosophical enigmas and questions but in a way that was actually fun to watch and that wasn't nearly three hours long (needlessly)?",4
2017-10-05,"Blade Runner is one of my all-time faves. Internet, I have opinions.",10
2017-10-05,"This is a much different beast than the original Blade Runner. And it's even better. Where Blade Runner was a sci-fi Noir, 20149 is a sci-fi epic.

2017-10-05,"Denis Villeneuve hasn't made a dud film yet, so I was particularly cautious about this outing. But right from the start this feels like a very faithful addition to the 1982 original, with beautiful vistas, wonderful score and a very measured slow pace and plot themes that continue to question what it is to be human.",8
2017-10-06,So bummed to say it but I found it tedious. It's rare to see a science fiction film so visually perfect with a fascinating story plumbed deeply but in the end the movie is too often boring and in love with itself. IMO It's the editing that failed. Too many plot jumps and holes. Too many exhaustingly long shots that don't add anything. Too many unnecessary flashbacks that insult your intelligence. You should still see it. In the theatre. It's visually delirious.,8
2017-10-06,Absolutely fantastic. It’s The Lars and the Real Girl sequel we all wanted. ,8
2017-10-06,There is so much bass in the score the cinema screen literally wobbled. Holy cow!,5
2017-10-06,Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner sequel is a great sci-fi film. What remains to be seen is how kind the coming decades are to its marvels.,8
2017-10-06,"Spectacular movie, a 2:45 running time that I didn’t want to end. Like the original, takes it time and requires some thought.",9
2017-10-06,"This film is amazing. It has an amazing sense of structure and drive, even when it doesn't follow the conventional story structure. The visuals are beautiful, and the script and story clever.",9
,"Sublime. As a film-lover (yes I know how wankerific that sounds), I live for films like this. It raises profound questions about Being and relationships and the link between personhood and memories, and isn't afraid to interrogate and explore them. And the visuals are mesmerizing. Watch it on the biggest screen you can. Deakins pulls out all the stops with some spectacular cinematography, lush dystopic shots and a really lovely use of colour. ",10
2017-10-05,Harrison Ford's first line of dialogue is about cheese. The rest of the movie's overwhelming sonic design is great but never lives up to that.,9

2017-10-06,Hey Denis teach me how to be amazing,10
2017-10-07,Sci-fi has been one of my favorite genre because it lets you experience a completely different world and Blade Runner 2049 delivers it. And there's no other way to see this other than on the big screen. This movie has so many layers and the slow burn is just fitting. Highly recommended to any fan of this genre.,10
2017-10-06,"As somebody who thinks the original Blade Runner is very good but extremely overrated, I was blown away by this one. Sci-fi perfection.",9
2017-10-05,"Almost definitely going to be giving this another look soon -- partially because of how dense it is, but also because it may very well be one of the most beautiful looking movies I've ever seen. (Maybe even more than the original.) I saw this in standard DCP* and it was as enormously immersive, the partnership between Villeneuve and Deakins continues to be one of the most fruitful artistic collaborations lately, and while it briefly evokes the OG Blade Runner…",9

2017-10-06,"Denis Villeneuve’s “Blade Runner 2049” is a fat fucking science fiction meal. This is grand, immersive film-making with ideas pouring out of the frames. This is not a film afraid to dream. If you can dial into its frequency early on, you will be transported.",9
2017-10-05,"After watching this movie I felt a bit deflated and underwhelmed as I was after watching the first one, with the only real difference being the way I arrived at such emotions. In fact, while in the case of the first one, the sense of deflation came as a consequence of very high expectations that were never met (storywise), here it came more with the progression of the movie itself.",7
2017-10-06,Gonna get drunk tonight to celebrate the day I have seen the most beautiful film ever made.,10
2017-10-05,We could all be Replicants and it wouldn't even matter.,10
2017-10-06,Maybe more words to come later but I loved this. Holding off on a five star rating until a second watch but this has potential. Perhaps understands Phillip K. Dick's soul better than the original? Who knows and cares? They're cut from the same cloth going for entirely different things.,9

2017-10-06,"Totally captures the look and atmosphere of the original, and also deserves praise for not being a lazy re-tread. 2049 is its own story in the Blade Runner universe, I really loved it but kept finding myself thinking “is it better than the first film?” (My favourite film), which was quite unfair.

2017-10-05,"The first thing that struck me was (as with the original) how amazing it looks. Visually, this is one of the best looking films I've EVER seen - It's utterly breathtaking in places. For that reason alone it's worth seeing. It doesn't stray too far in feel from its predecessor and, for fans of the original, it's a very welcome relief. Is it film of the year? Not for me. But I can absolutely see why, come award season, this beautiful movie might just clean up.",8
2017-10-06,I never thought I'd say this one day but I didn't care at all about what happened to Ryan Gosling,5
2017-10-06,"I extremely recommend this film to everybody who likes fascinating science fiction or futuristic films. Its just in every point perfect and I have nothing to criticize. Definitely one of the best movies I watched in this year. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford play their roles very solid, good and convincing. The visuals are gorgeous and absolutely stunning. Especially the music from Hans Zimmer is ingenious made and every tone of the music really touches someone no matter if its the bass or the tenor. Every single bit and bite of this film is outstanding and unsurpassable.",10
2017-10-06,"So many adjectives to use here but its a hell of a movie. It doesn't necessarily add a lot in thematics to this alienated, cruel, beautiful world, but I think its take on love and sexuality as something both programmed and complicated, compelling simply because it exists at all is painful - one scene in particular early on almost made me cry in its depiction of simulated yet unsimulated loneliness. How much of our thoughts, our emotions, our actions are…",9
2017-10-06,"Ridley Scott’s 1982 science-fiction classic Blade Runner is given a sequel here helmed by Denis Villeneuve as Ryan Gosling stars as a Replicant (artificial human) working with the law to catch his own kind when he discovers proof of a child born from a Replicant, which brings him to the reclusive Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). 2049 drops most of the noir trappings of its big brother and adds almost an hour in length, to being a touch under three hours…",8

2017-10-05,"I didn't think that it could be done, but Denis Villenueve has delivered a Blade Runner sequel that not only equals the original, but may even surpass it. Like the Ridley Scott film, I'll need a few more rewatches to truly process Blade Runner 2049. I can definitely say that 2049 is a more emotional viewing experience than the original film; Villenueve is simply a better storyteller than Ridley Scott. While Blade Runner can be a difficult film to vibe…",10

2017-10-05,Okay just so stunning in every aspect. It did a wonderful job of paying homage to Blade Runner (1982) without letting that take away from the original story line of this masterpiece. ,9

2017-10-06,I'd let Villeneuve suck the marrow out of my bones with a straw at this point.,8

2017-10-06,"A visually stunning, heady and unfortunately slow science fiction epic. The story is very much a sequel in every sense of the word so to give any synopsis would be a spoiler. ",8
2017-10-06,"This could easily be cut from a 163 minute tour to a 100-120 minute journey. One of the main problems that I had with this sequel is the fact that there seems to be a lot of scenes that are just placed to show off the fact that the force that is Roger ""Where's the Cinematogrpahy Oscar"" Deakins is involved with the film. There's a fair share of unneeded/ irrelevant scenes within the film that could be given to more…",4
2017-10-06,Phenomenal filmmaking! Love the tone and it stayed true to the first film and expanded it further. Seen a lot of Ryan Gosling movies this year and all of them great. May be Denis Villeneuve's best work IMO.  Long run time but epic and visually stunning.,10

2017-10-06,Just go and see it already.,10
2017-10-06,"I KNEW that would be the opening scene as soon as I heard Hampton Fancher was writing it haha. Certainly visually spectacular. Mix was a tad loud, could be the theatre I was in but I doubt it. Takes it's time, pacing is similar to the original so that's nice. Don't see it going over too well with the general movie going audience though but who cares about that. Last piece of music nearly made me hard. Gonna need a rewatch to fully digest this, it could easily go up.",9
2017-10-06,"Manages to keep the heart of the original while also finding its own identity. As aesthetically bold and interesting as the original, and maintaining much of the film's deeper philosophies. It's nice to have a sequel made long after the original that doesn't suck.",8
2017-10-06,Cinema. Personified.,10
2017-10-06,to be fair i haven't watched the first one yet so i couldn't compare and contrast much or at all really but i'm giving it 5 stars because of its exceptionally STUNNING visuals and its sense of realism. the plotline was brilliant however it was a bit stretched out but it wasn't a problem for me due to its incredible cinematography. also ryan gosling is so pretty.,10
2017-10-06,Never thought about the gifts of small things that surround us each day before Blade Runner 2049.,9
2017-10-06,"I wondered if this movie would have held up if Harrison had said no to the sequel (and yes, it does help to watch the first one before trekking onto this one). But Denis Villeneuve crafted a sequel that seamlessly continues from the first one without being ""har har SEQUEL let me put all the references"" and allowed the characters to breathe in with the walls and buildings that this California in 2049 has to offer.

,One of the best movies ever made.,10

2017-10-06,"Denis Villeneuve is an extraordinary talent and here he has achieved a remarkable feat of both the familiar and the utterly fresh. The look and feel of the 'world' feels straight out of Scott's original film, yet tonally the two films couldn't be much more different.",6

After finishing it you are so completely full that you need to take the rest of the night to just sit, process, and digest what you just experienced. That's Blade Runner 2049. I saw it a few hours ago and I am still in complete awe. I couldn't believe three hours could go by so fast.",10

The cinematography was perfect for the tone of the film, and I wanted to just pause it throughout the film and review each shot. The sound mixing was great, as well as the edgy soundtrack. Though the film is almost 3 hours, there are some uneven parts, like explaining more about Leto's villain character. I'm hoping they continue the franchise in this scifi-noir world.",8

I would have assumed that as necessary, but two other people who had NEVER seen the 1982 flick seemed just as entertained as I was with this sequel. And it's hard to get real entertained at anything that's nearly three hours long.",8
2017-10-06,"At the same time that this is a sequence, it is also a tribute, picking up all the elements of the original and elevating to another level. It has the noir felling, but just as in the classic '82 the investigation is left in the background, focusing on the atmosphere created, and on reflections such as human nature, memories, human and machine.",10

2017-10-06,It’s become apparent that Dennis Villenueve has grown into one of those rare individuals in the industry who can reliably produce a near masterpiece if he were to receive a blank check for any amount.

2017-10-06,"It's quite an undertaking to make a companion piece to one of the greatest films ever made.  That he chose to take on this project shows a lot about director Denis Villeneuve's belief in himself.  Villeneuve certainly has the ability to produce jaw-dropping shots reminiscent of Tarkovsky, Welles, Kubrick, and Lang.  It also helps when you have veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins (responsible for such classics as Fargo, Big Lebowski, and No Country for Old Men, just to name a few)…",7

Films like this and Fury Road prove you can revisit hallowed ground and not desecrate it. If Fury Road was the Heavy Metal equivalent of films, 2049 is Industrial as fuck",10
,"Roger Deakins is a god, and there is a lot to commend, but this movie really tried my patience in the latter half. There's no excuse for the bloated runtime. Maybe studio intervention isn't always a bad thing. This felt like an indulgent director's cut that belongs on a blu-ray. Give me a 2 hour cut, please. Even then, I'm not too impressed with the story. Sure is pretty to look at, though, and Ana de Armas steals her scenes.",6

The plot was a bit too convoluted for my tastes (I felt the same way about Blade Runner, but not Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, so I don't think it's due to any sort of intrinsic confusion), but still touched on the expected topics of the genre and series well. The biggest drawback was that it was certainly longer than it needed it to be; multiple scenes could have been trimmed or elided without much negative effect, I think.",8

2017-10-07,"Wow. This was everything I wanted from a belated sequel. Philosophical, gritilly gorgeous and brutal with moments of visual surrealism. Blade Runner 2049 remains faithful to the original story yet also displays Villneuve's auterist sensibilities in every gilded, dust speckled, neon-lit frame.",9

It manages to recapture the sober aesthetic and atmosphere of the original to beautiful effect, but I'd argue that this one was far more intellectual than its predecessor.

All the thematic stuff about connection and separation and…",9
2017-10-06,"It takes some serious balls to pick up the mantle and even bother trying to make a sequel to the illustrious Blade Runner but somehow Denis Villeneuve has managed to do it.

Ryan Gosling manages to hold control of this monumentally long movie at all times…",9
2017-10-06,A modern masterpiece. Not as good as the first but it is a glorious continuation that feels like a completely different movie but yet in a universe that has changed and expanded but yet shared key important thematic elements that feel unique.

2017-10-06,"Half-way through the words ""take me Denis"" crossed my mind....I was in",9
,"A bit more straightforward (but certainly not dumbed down in any way) and less open to interpretation than the original, but a very solid sequel that actually works as a 30-years-later-follow-up on the world established in Blade Runner, rather than an exact imitation of its well-remembered visuals. Familiar, but no rehash. ",8
,Not bad for a movie that skipped 2047 sequels.,9

Ford is used just enough, and Leto is barely in it. Falls short of 5 stars because of some third act problems, but it’s fantastic to look at.",9
2017-10-05,Visually this is an absolute stunner!! Incredible sound and set design. It is a bleak place in 2049 LA but those stunning golden mustard hues are magnificent. It's run time is long but doesn't feel that way. The story unfolds like as a mystery so stay away from reviews that spoil things. For me weak points are the Jared Leto scenes and the very heavy male gaze of the film.Harrison Ford is great. There is a great deal to sink into here...what does it mean to be human etc. Can't wait to rewatch this.,9
,"Blade Runner is one of my all-time favorite movies. I love its plot, I love the third act, but more than anything I love its style and tone. Its futuristic setting is advanced yet primitive, gripping and isolating. It feels gritty. It feels dirty. So I’d been cautiously optimistic for Blade Runner 2049, and now that I’ve seen it, I can safely say it’s a worthy sequel to the best cyberpunk film of all-time. ",10

This is  definitely without a doubt, Denise Villenueve’s minimalism ‘cyberpunk’ masterpiece. Roger Deakin’s cinematography and Villenueve’s dark, grungy, vibrant directing style go hand in hand. They both seriously should work together more often, they both know what they’re doing. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford were electrifying as always. Will definitely go back for another time to rewatch this beautiful artistry.",9

Blockbusters use small, character-based moments as grout between bombastic set-pieces, yet Blade Runner 2049 chooses to ignore this strategy.

,"Beautiful, mysterious, often impenetrable, occasionally quite languorous. In other words, pretty much the perfect sequel to Ridley Scott's original film, though Denis Villeneuve is even more content to just drop his audience in the middle of this immaculately detailed sci-fi future and kinda hang out. No complaints here, considering we're hanging out with Roger Deakins's cinematography and Dennis Gassner's production design. But I'd be lying if I said the plot's engine didn't start to sputter and run on fumes a…",8

2017-10-06,"There's already been a lot of great things said about this movie, but I think one of 2049's greatest strengths is that it's less ambiguous than the original. I realize the ambiguity is part of Blade Runner's appeal, but in 2049 we're given more ideas, characterizations, and motives to work with. Leaving the theater, I felt like I had a better connection with this story and these characters than I did in the first one.",10

In most ways, it’s more a Denis Villeneuve movie than a 'Blade Runne'r sequel; for some, that’ll be an endorsement, and for others, a warning. (Act accordingly.) But it does something sci-fi movies rarely do anymore, and sequels do even less: it shows us things we’ve never seen.",8

It subverts nostalgia in really intelligent and intriguing ways.",10

2017-10-06,OH MY GOSH!!!!!!Thank you Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins!!!!!! Ryan Gosling was honestly made for this role. His non-verbal acting skills were out of this world. I honestly preferred the scenes where there was absolutely no dialogue. The visuals were of course brilliant. I can honestly see a huge problem with the runtime for other people but I enjoyed every second of it. I was completely immersed into this world. I couldn't stop thinking about how half the surroundings and backgrounds were probably not CGI'd or green screened.,9

Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast, and his heavenly chemistry with Ana de Armas is the best I've seen for a very long time. Their sex scene together is, in my opinion, one of (if not THE most) beautiful to be put on the big screen. Best of the year so far. A delight to watch.",10
,"Blade Runner. An 80's futuristic film noir that some filmgoers revere as one of the all-time great films.. with a caveat. Which of the endings did you see? The right one? or the really bad happy ending? Few films give the viewers their own personal ultimatum for the characters, but the first Blade Runner was that indecisive. So is it then, wise to give Blade Runner a 35 year old sequel/reboot? It apparently is. It turns out that Denis Villeneuve…",9

Blade runner had that same appeal when it first came out and this one had that same appeal as well. It was nice to see Harrison Ford show emotions in this movie and Ryan Gosling, well yum.

Every year he pumps visually gorgeous films. This guy is the only guy to do a Dune reboot. Hans Zimmer kills it again with another brilliant on point score this year. The technology updates compliment the original and also seem more relevant to how our current technology is advancing. I certainly…",9
2017-10-07,"Is there anything Denis Villeneuve cannot do? He makes an almost three hour movie in a universe already set by someone else, and it works.

Moreover, Gosling was quite perfectly cast, as was Armas. However, the scenes with Leto and those with and pertaining to Ford's character I wasn't very happy with, and I found the script rather underwhelming as a whole. Nonetheless, it's a movie I can see myself rewatching repeatedly in order to soak up it's atmosphere and delicious visuals.",8

2017-10-05,"After seeing the original earlier in the week I assumed the sequel would have all the standard concessions of a modern day blockbuster - more action, faster pace, less ambiguous etc. How wrong I was. Blade Runner 2049 is an astonishing, mind-melting opus that shares the measured, introspective spirit of the original. It's a 3 hour art film that tells a brilliant story in an - at times - inert fashion. ",8

It will be extremely difficult to improve on this, and if The Last Jedi pulls it off it will, by default, be a transcendent masterpiece. ",10

It throws lots of ideas a lot the wall that don’t all stick, but what did will stay with me for a long time. It captures the essence of the original while raising the scope exponentially. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the incredible work done by Roger Deakins, which elevates the film one step above just great. My favorite film of 2017 so far.",10

2017-10-07,"In movies like Blade Runner the questions are ALWAYS more interesting than the answers and this asks a lot of questions. The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't feel like they are trying to redo/recapture the first film, it is very much its own entity, tells its own story, and does not rely on the original. Denis Villenuve made a impossible sequel into the perfect sequel. This film will be remembered as one of the greatest sequels and a visual triumph.",9

And after seeing 2049, I can safety say I can add another film to my all-time favorites. Blade Runner 2049 takes us back to the dark dystopian future of Los Angeles, only 30 years have passed since we last saw it. And it has changed.

2017-10-06,"The original Blade Runner is one of my favourite films of all time, and I think to be, one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. Creating a sequel to such an iconic and culturally significant movie is not an easy task and I was very trepadacious about a sequel to Blade Runner being created. There are certain questions about the nature of specific characters that could be tainted with the creation of a sequel, and the ending of the…",8
2017-10-05,"What I appreciate most about this is that it expands the aesthetic of the original, definitely still caring about the dark and bleak look of this future, but allowing more brightness in its vision. Even more than Dunkirk, Blade Runner 2049 is a sensory experience. I think on a rewatch (which is coming soon), some of the story elements may not work as well (I called some of the early ones without trying), but I think enough else still works that I’m happy to call it better than the original (which wasn’t that good to begin with).",8
2017-10-05,"Minus 1/2 a star because it suffers from sequel-has-to-explain-stuff syndrome. We didn't need some sci-fi explanation (if it even was one), or even acknowledgement of the ""falling in love"" that happened in the first movie.

,FUCKING PHENOMENAL! It's so refreshing to get a big budget hollywood film that's this good! Especially one that sticks to it's guns both thematically and stylistically. Legit the best hollywood release so far this year and I'd doubt it'll be surpassed given the still impending line up. ,9
2017-10-07,"Yes, it's a bit messy, over-long, and coldly ponderous--so was the original, and that didn't stop it from being an ambitious, mesmerizing, and completely successful effort. In fact, Blade Runner's rough edges (and perhaps those of its sequel, though time will tell) are what make it stick in the head, its themes and ideas not quite didactic but delightfully slippery, open to new readings and discoveries.",8
2017-10-06,"What an experience. I feel like I need to watch it again, because I'm sure I didn't take from the movie everything it has to offer. It's not flawless: sometimes the cuts are too abrupt and the dialogs explain a little too much. But then, Blade Runner isn't perfect either, and its small flaws never prevented me from loving it. Probably it's one of the best movie sequences, because while you can recognize that it's still Blade Runner, it's actually…",10

,"Awash with expansive but unfulfilling landscape shots, each cut emphasized with a big synth bass hit. Villeneuve goes for sensory overload rather than convincing world design. There were a few well-crafted exceptions - the shallow pool office and the Mad Max-esque red desert statues were striking and beautiful. Pounding floor toms should be made illegal in film - it's not a soundtrack, it's empty and uncreative. Redundant and drudging narrative. The melding scene was a highlight - appropriately uncanny.",6

Later cuts of the movie are absent the narration and are better for it.",6

Director Denis Villeneuve deserves a lot of praise for making a sequel to the original cult classic work. Although I think the main praise deserves to go to…",10

2017-10-07,"A hypnotic sludge through pieces of Scott's world via Villeneuve and Deakins. Manages to present the common cinematic query of ""what makes a human a human?"" without stepping on the same old arguments we've seen before. It manages to come to some conclusions on this, but in true Blade Runner fashion, it isn't the answers we would hope for. I can't remember the last time I saw a 3 hour movie and wanted it to go on for another hour. Hanging out in K/Joe's reality was pure bliss.",9

But let's face facts, for all it's sci-fi porn, Blade Runner is a pretty messy movie. It's far too long, its main character is a cliched noir detective, parts of it don't make a lot of sense, and its narrative is pretty mundane once you get past…",9

2017-10-07,"Just like the original, this is a thinker, and can't be fully understood after the first viewing. But what I can decide on now is this is masterful science fiction filmmaking from one of the best directors in the business, pristine work from Roger Deakins, etc; this movie is technically flawless. And very much its own thing, distinct from Scott's film, and as such asks its own questions.",9
2017-10-06,"2nd screening but in IMAX this time. The visuals were even more amazing this time around. The 3D from my first screening was nice for the extra layer of depth, but cinema 3D image really suffers in the color department (scenes seem darker than they should be and colors are a bit reduced). ",10
2017-10-07,"Bridging Alien and Blade Runner in subtle ways, the film offers the usual Villeneuvian intense progress, which is well tailored for the asphyxiated nipponized Los Angeles we are dwelling into.

Talking about the substance beyond intensity, action sequences and good drama, the Biblical pool of ideas don't really raise all the…",8
2017-10-07,"Beautiful. On a visual level, this is absolutely breathtaking. Almost a masterpiece. Until the scenes after Harrison Ford is taken by the antagonists, I was ready to write that wholly gushing review.

Also, the ending didn't punch quite so hard as the original, though it's still excellent. ",9

I feel bad for anyone who has the story spoiled for them, because the basic beats can fit into the character-limit of a tweet. I wish I could say that the film makes up for the lack of story with compelling, multi-dimensional characters, but the film also eschews any semblance of character development.…",5

It stays clear of the ""save the world"" pitfall of most action blockbusters, and keeps its story fairly contained, while still expanding upon the groundwork of its predecessor.

The original film is one that it took me a few viewings to come around to, but on the most recent watch I really fell in love with it. ",7
2017-10-07,I was a bit dissapointed to be honest. Maybe more drawn out establishing shots would have helped.,7
2017-10-07,"Visually stunning - if Deakins doesn’t win an Oscar it’s a travesty - but sadly lacking sequel. The most interesting strand of the film comes far too late to have its full resonance, with the first half of the film struggling to achieve pace or any sense of importance with how bloated it is. Many of the themes have been Better explored in films like Ex Machina and Her. To quote Mackenzie Davis’s blessedly plausible sex worker, “I’ve been inside you.

Especially in the cinema, absolutely rippling through.- the themes of the Blade Runner world were sustained through this sequel. Creation & birth, biology vs. souls, what it means to have purpose or just be physical happenstance. Love that stuff. Sexistential. - the visuals were beautiful. Amazing colours. Amazing scenery. Amazing set/world design. - the tidal fight scene had my toes curling in suspense.- Ryan Gosling",9

The reason why that doesn't matter so much is because honestly, I never really cared about the mystery in the original either.

2017-10-07,"It's good. I will write more once I see it again. For now, I'll just say that it is conceptually/thematically much stronger than the first because it has internalized the growth of how we conceptualize the future, machinery, reality, screens, alienation, control, etc as well as the lessons learned from films along the Shaviro axis from Strange Days to New Rose Hotel to Southland Tales to Detention.

I thought the acting and writing were also very strong, it was even sexy/sensual at times.

2017-10-07,"Blown away. The vision and the execution. The camera and the dystopia. Less philosophical than the predecessor. Leaves you wanting for more. Especially of Leto. With all those short films, the universe gives an infinite potential feel. May be more films? Such a heavy anime vibe the whole film had.",10

2017-10-07,One of the best sequels ever!,9
2017-10-07,"First off, the second half is so much better than the first. Second, the holo-girlfriend character and subplot should have been completely cut from the movie; it adds nothing and feels like a cheap Her knockoff.",8
2017-10-07,the best science fiction movie i've seen in forever. incredible set design and music and just everything. everything about it was ugh fucking great!!,10

2017-10-07,"An admirable patience, even if there may be a bit too much room at times, that functions as many great sci-fi films in the past have: by using the characters and unfamiliar to ask the viewer to confront questions about the human condition, and it does so in a way that serves as an inverse of the original.",5
2017-10-07,"What a wonderful film. Villeneuve again gets it and refresh the franchise in a way no one hoped. Such good story, performance, directing and cinematography by Roger Deakins. 5/5",10
2017-10-07,"Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins. You are two magnificent sons of bitches. Give these men the Oscars they deserve already. But for real, while I still have to see the OG I still thought this movie was great. It also didn’t feel like 2 hours and 45 minutes. Not much else to say except this is my new favorite of the year and please see this movie it’s amazing.",10

2017-10-07,"Saw this one with some friends from work, and wow, it was stunning. I'm not a rabid diehard fan of the original, though I like it a lot, so I was already on board with whatever direction Ridley Scott and Denis Villeneuve wanted to take this movie, and I was not at all disappointed. It's probably anathema to say, but I liked this one a lot more than the original, with some reservations about some lingering story questions, character motivations,…",9
2017-10-07,"This movie, these stories, they’re what got me into film. Denis does an amazing job, it’s just so surreal and beautiful, this movie was so good. The whole crew that worked in this movie made a masterpiece. Also thank you Ryan Gosling for looking so good with blood on your face.",10

2017-10-07,"Phillip K Dick would be proud... this Film emphasized all of the notions that the 1982 Film hinted at and did everything beautiful justice. Easily, 2049 is the most visually and sonically stunning theatergoing experience I’ve had recently and that’s not even mentioning the STORY. The film is 3 hours long and here I am only asking for more more more; I will not say a word about it. Enjoy:) 10/10",10
2017-10-07,"Chris Stuckmann said that this is a film that’s going to create film makers, and I couldn’t agree more. This is a cinematic milestone for science fiction. My eyes have never been provoked in this way by a film. It reaches my head and my heart like the first film does, yet is totally solid on its own merits. God there is so much I want to say about this film, but I think I’ll have to wait for future…",10
2017-10-07,Um I mean I expected more but um it was um good but um not great,6
2017-10-05,"Incredible sequel and one of the best looking films ever made. Roger Deakins better win this year, or we at Letterboxd will riot or write some strongly worded reviews explaining how brilliant this movie looks. Gosling and Ford play off each other really well, definitely better than I thought they would. The screenplay has little drags here and there, but overall, incredibly detailed and full of the philosophical underpinnings that made the first film so mesmerizing. And Villenueve, again proves himself worthy of the 'auteur' title he's earned after incredible work like Arrival and Sicario.",9
2017-10-07,"I enjoyed it more, but it's still a four.",8
,"Denis Villeneuve does it again. It wasn't until Sicario and Arrival that the director popped his way into my favorite directors. This film confirms his spot on the list.  Blade Runner 2049 is a brilliant and emotional piece of Sci-Fi film-making that is sure to become a classic in the coming years. It has excellent characters, an intriguing story and beautiful visuals. Blade Runner 2049 is one of those rare sequels that instead of ""trying"" to be bigger and better…",10

My initial thoughts were as follows: ",9
2021-01-03,No greater example of the Monkey’s Paw than “and Jared Leto” rolling on the credits of this bad boy. You know he shot his two scenes on his own?

,"commits so many of the same overly self-conscious sins that this wave of nostalgic reboots like the force awakens does, but because villeneuve presents it in his detached, faux-meditative way, it resembles concept art more than a movie, with no interest in communicating via camera movement or editing. ridley scott painted the future as a darkly glamorous fairy-tale, synthesized through the psychedelic bleeding edge genius of PKD and vangelis; 2049 promptly ignores all that cool shit and stuffs the legacy of speculative sci-fi into the bourgeois confines of a coffee table art book. this might as well be a case of cinematic taxidermy.",4

There just isn’t much going on and what little is there, isn’t that interesting.

2024-02-04,The highly anticipated sequel of Blade Runner certainly did not disappoint. It’s a poignant and compelling story that is a phenomenal testament to the original prequel. We delve deeper into the future of other worlds between facades of human nature in the light and darkness. The haunting and masterful score emanates from the visual shots that are implemented in a sensational glory.,10

2020-05-19,Happy to say that my thoughts towards this are much kinder on a rewatch. I'm kind of embarrassed by the person I was when I saw this back in 2017. An angry liberal feminist who judged the representation of women as 'good' or 'bad' with no in-between. I wouldn't call myself a liberal anymore and I'm a little less angry. I hopefully have more room for nuance. 3 years of film studies and critical theory will do that.,8

It builds upon the first film not with nostalgia, but instead by answering the first’s question…what does it mean to be human? 2049 proposes the thesis that to be human is to be loved by someone else.

2021-02-16,"While I still enjoy it a lot as a big fan of cyberpunk stuff, Blade Runner 2049 is the very definition of style over substance. It sacrifices the subtlety, the tension and most of the philosophy of the original for cool visuals and a blaring soundtrack that makes my headphones vibrate. The social commentary is extremely spoon fed and I personally don’t find the narrative very compelling, making it somewhat of a drag to get through it’s near 3 hour runtime. However, this is made up for with it’s scale and grandiosity. It’s far from perfect, but nothing looks or sounds as cool as this.",8
2021-02-06,WOW this movie is amazing. It’s a masterpiece. Only reason it’s not 5 stars is because some of it was spoiled to me. Ryan Goslings performance is amazing.

I found Blade Runner 2049 to obviously be visually stunning, but also rather bleak and tense. Ana Da Armas is beautiful, Robin Wright played yet another badass in 2017 and Ryan Gosling is handsome and a formidable actor.

2024-05-19,"This film remains stunning. Zimmer’s score reminds us of what he and his associates are capable of and lives in its own distinct world from Vangelis’ groundbreaking work. It’s so different from the first yet leaves me speechless in its own way. 2049 explores parts of the book the first doesn’t and for that it truly makes a worthy sequel. But beyond that, this film is a magnificent accomplishment. The fact that the first is better is not a failure of this film, but a testament to the greatness of the original. This is a perfect movie.",10

2024-05-19,"Sorry Dune-heads, this, to me, is Denis best movie",10
2024-05-19,In my opinion Denis Villeneuve’s best film and one of my all time favourites. Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas putting in stellar performance’s. Presenting the viewer with the question ‘what does it mean to be human’. A slow but purposeful film as Officer K tries to solve a mystery left behind by Decker of the original movie.,10

2024-05-18,It’s interesting to see this on the big screen having recently watched Dune: Part Two. There’s so much of Villeneuve’s style showing itself in Blade Runner 2049 that becomes more fleshed out and confident in the Dune movies.

2024-05-13,denis villeneuve casually drops one of greatest movies everit’s really interesting how this movie is the opposite of the original blade runner in a lot of ways. thematically and technically. the themes of the first movie are explored much more meaningfully here in a way i really wasn’t expecting. everything in this is remarkable.,10

2024-05-13,WowThis film excels in so many things. A sequel made almost 40 years after the first keeps true to so much of the world and the story whilst also making it so much better. ,10
2024-05-13,cinematic masterpiece all throughout. love the dystopian futuristic Los Angeles . the film portrays male loneliness exceptionally well and shows K figuring out joy is just a computer program he can make into whatever he wants . overall a great follow up to harrison ford blade runner,10

2024-05-13,film isn’t even one of the best i’ve seen but the film is for some reason so so good,10
2024-05-13,"Denis Villenueve is incredible. This is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever seen in my life. From the cinematography, to the score. Everything was just spectacular. Villenueve’s cinematography is always phenomenal and that absolutely stayed true here. This is probably the best Ryan Gosling performance I have seen so far. His aura is unmatched. Ana De Armas was enthralling throughout this film. Harrison Ford was also fantastic as always. Blade Runner 2049 is truly a modern masterpiece.",10

2024-05-12,"I went into this really expecting to have the same feelings as I did after watch Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. As I did enjoy that film, I was never truly locked into the story, but more was interested in the cinematics. Blade Runner 2049 is an instant favorite of mine after first watching. I don’t know if i’ve ever been this locked into a science fiction project… ever. Visually this may just be the greatest motion picture ever created. The score…",10
2024-05-12,About once a year I rewatch this movie just to remember the plot. Nothing super duper exciting but the aesthetic is my vibe. I’ve had ryan gosling as my home screen wallpaper for some years and I don’t plan on changing it bc he’s that good of an actor. INTERLINKED!,10

2024-05-12,"I never watched the original blade runner until recently and now that I've seen both films I've gone into the deepest depths of its universe and will never find my way out again. Saying it's incredible is somewhat of an understatement. Dennis Villeneuve has made a fantastic addition to the series, the film he's made may be even better than the original. I will wish every night forever that we will see another Blade Runner by Dennis Villeneuve. It's much more engaging and interesting than Dune for me. Though not as commercially viable which is a travesty for film.",10
2024-05-12,"Stunning visuals, incredible score and a suspensful story. Denis Villeneuve took the few things I liked about the original and made something incredible.",10

2024-05-11,"Yeah, I like this Denis guy. Also, Ryan Gosling is so great. I watched a few interviews of his and he’s just always so awkwardly funny and it’s so good. Although it was a long movie, it went by quickly. When they referred to the beginning of the film at the end, I really felt like the beginning had happened like 20 hours ago and not 2.",10

Denis Villeneuve has such artistry as a director, sound design, visuals and cinematography are A1 in this movie and I see a lot of his techniques carried over into the Dune Franchise. This is easily one of my favorites with Ryan Gosling and the way the story was structured by following his character and the rabbit hole he goes down through his mission was incredible.",10

2024-05-11,"Just a phenomenal time. This movie is so good at slowly unfolding its story while keeping you captivated with artistic world building. The use of color and overall cinematography was amazing. I also think this movie really benefitted from having an R rating. While limited, the stuff that gave this movie an R really packs a punch. Ryan Gosling and the whole cast put their heart into this sequel to make sure it was done right and you can tell. I loved this movie and am excited to revisit it.",10

2024-05-11,"I would say this rewatch brought to me the clearest glance at the true thematic depth of this film. To me, this was all about identity. That point is clearly hammered home. However, as a whole, this film had to be the perfect sequel to Blade Runner. Frames from this film manage to somehow recreate familiarity and yet still fill you with wonder of discovery in new parts of the old. And most importantly, the idea of having spent a…",10

2024-05-10,"Denis Villeneuve once again proves that he is the best director for modern sci-fi.

2024-05-10,I love this movie so much it’s visually so breathtakingly beautiful. I don’t like artificial intelligence though so that is my only problem with this film. In my opinion I feel like AI technology has been around for a lot longer than we think. I bet some whole movie's from as early as the late 90s were created fully with AI. I feel like a lot of news broadcasts are AI too and have been for awhile. Just think about it the government probably had the AI technology for awhile and are just now deciding to introduced it to the general public.,10

From the sprawling neon-lit cityscapes to the desolate wastelands, every frame is meticulously crafted, evoking a sense of wonder and dread. Ryan Gosling delivers a haunting and nuanced performance as K, capturing the character's internal conflict with a quiet intensity.

The performances are top-notch, with Ryan Gosling delivering a nuanced portrayal of the conflicted protagonist. The story is engaging and keeps you guessing until the very end, exploring complex themes of identity, humanity, and the nature of consciousness.

Explores the facets of humanity, reaching depraved depths and hopeful optimism in the same breath. Ryan Gosling is pitch perfect in this, and I hope he doesn’t become typecast as Ken (which is looking unfortunately more and more likely.)

2024-04-16,Simply put - Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best films I’ve ever watched. This movie feels more like a movie set in the same universe than an actual sequel. Villeneuve has expanded on the best parts of Ridley Scott’s original film and wastes no time in telling an amazing story. All the acting is exceptional and the cinematography is world class.

Strong sense of the production running out of money near the end. Cash grab for above the line participants. Jared Leto gives his best Marlon Brando impersonation.

2024-03-20,"Not at all as good as the first one, cant even compare them",2
2024-03-19,"insanely boring, i discovered that i can actually fall asleep during a movie",2

2024-03-04,Boring. Predictable. Not half as beautiful as the first one.,2
2024-03-01,"Denis just doesn’t make movies that I enjoy. Great sound and cinematography, but most of his films have almost nothing else to offer. Shitty dialogue (he openly says he doesn’t care about the writing), weak characters, and boring scene after boring scene. He made Ryan Gosling lifeless and that’s hard to do. ",2
2024-03-01,After watching that I went to run into ongoing traffic it was so bad,2

,I can’t believe Harrison agreed to this hot steaming pile of garbage. It made me physically angry. The camera work and visuals were the only redeeming quality. The first blade runner is the only blade runner.,2

2024-01-25,A very visually beautiful movie but I have a lot of issues with various plot armor and the treatment of women in this film. It’s catered to the heterosexual male gaze. It feels very aesthetically pleasing but so much of this film could’ve been cut out in favor of plot. Instead we just have very slow pace scenes and… shots of a bug?,2
2024-01-24,"Photography and film shoots are very nice compared to the original one. Script is beyond chaotic, seems I am watching the sci fi version of Beautiful.",2

2024-01-19,I know everyone likes this but I find it painfully boring. I like long slow movies but this gives me nothing to hold onto.,2
2024-01-17,I watched this film. Forgot I watched it and went back to it thinking I’d only seen half. That I realised I had indeed watched it. That about says it all really.,2

Most of the movie felt like world building, I really liked alot of the concepts though and the imagining of the future is really interesting and creative.

2023-12-06,I literally redownloaded this app because of this movie it’s three hours I’ll never get back. I’m obviously no movie critic cuz it has an 88 percent on rotten tomatoes but that was the most slow and confusing movie ever the only reason I kept watching was Ryan gosling,2

They want you to think that this is an “intelligent” movie, and that if you like it you’re an astute film fan… this movie is a three hour trudge through cgi in which there are no character development nor and real plot progression. This movie makes the error of asking the viewer to care about an android with no emotions. And for 2 hours and 50 minutes nothing happens regarding the main character anyway so it really won’t matter…",2

2023-11-01,I expected to like this movie.. But honestly half the time i was just uncomfortable in the “bought gf” and naked women 24/7. It didnt add anything to the movie and the whole time women are just there to be spoken about in terms of “can they give birth” or “can I fuck them”,2
2023-11-01,"i dont think i missed the intention of the plot, yada yada gaining humanity and stuff but like it was so boring.Boring is in reference to the pacing being 2 hours long, but it only really gets exciting at like 2 hours in, which is a crime because why are they trying to setup for another film in the franchise without first trying to write a coherent well thought out one first.ugh whatever its my fault for not…",2

2023-10-01,"For years, I’ve felt detached from the moviegoing public, alone in my utter ambivalence for Hollywood’s current arthouse golden boy Denis Villeneuve. I gave it up for Polytechnique, which felt urgent and undeniable in its depiction of humanity’s cruelty and subsequent tenacity required to overcome it. But since then, his movies have felt like a continual depression, a sluggish dive into barren mediocrity weighed down by banal observations about life. They aren’t banal because Villeneuve isn’t smart, which I believe…",2
2023-09-26,Couldn't get past the 40 minute mark-- the treatment of women is just disgusting and I can't believe how normalised it is similarly to ex machina. Sure Denis may be trying to make a commentary but does it really matter if this is how he does it? Bc this all just seems like a man's gross perverted wet dream of a dystopia.. Where nothing suggests to the viewer that this treatment of women is wrong in any way. It disturbs…,2

2023-09-22,One of the worst things I’ve ever watched actually fell asleep.,2

I feel asleep 15 minutes in, woke up at the 30 minute mark to see I hadn’t missed anything and went back to sleep, waking up intermittently to see I hadn’t missed anything more. The original is a classic. This isn’t. Harrison Ford has the good sense to show up with only 30 minutes left. He looks bored. He must have watched the previous two hours before shooting his scenes.",2

I desperately wanted to know beyond what was happening, rather, what it all meant. This craving to know transformed into hunger, my mouth a desert and my tongue a sand dune.

2023-01-02,loved the cinematography but the film was sadly so boring :(,2
2023-01-01,ryan gosling looks this soullness in every movie,2
2022-12-31,I was bored,2
2022-12-29,watched with sab and her dad and my bestie and I didnt know wtf was going on,2
2022-12-29,Would rather eat a jean jacket with nothing other than a bottle of French’s yellow mustard and a plastic spork than watch this poopfest of an overrated boring movie >:(,2
2022-12-29,Literally me,2
2022-12-29,i feel like i’m missing the point of this movie,2
2022-12-28,"watched this on an 8 hour plane trip, after thinking about it for a bit i’ll be honest and say that it was pretty shit. it was boring, mysoginistic and everyone’s acting was ass too. why is jared leto there? cinematography is cool though, i’ll admit the sets and the lighting were nice",2
2022-12-24,sometimes visually interesting misogyny,2
2022-12-21,Review coming: when it's ready.,2
2022-12-17,1* bc of Jared Leto,2
,"Some of the most pretentious, boring nonsense I have ever seen. It has a pretty aesthetic, but that's it's only redeeming quality.",2
2022-12-15,now i won’t say i don’t get bc i don’t want men to call me stupid but i will say this shit makes no cents 🤪 sowy ana de armas was the only thing keeping me going,2
2022-12-07,"The ONLY reason I gave this movie a 1/5 was because of Jared Leto. Not even lying. The only good scenes were the ones that had him in them. If I’m being completely and brutally honest, it was a flaming hot garbage fire of a movie, worse than the first one. All of the first Blade Runner’s faults carried on into this movie; it’s severe lack of plot and character depth specifically. I have so many issues with this movie…",2
2022-12-04,first and only movie i've ever walked out of in a cinema as a result of sheer boredom,2
2022-12-03,"This movie has so much potential and it uses some of it, but crushes it with its very painfully slow pacing. I have been on my phone the whole time im sorry but i cant finish it 😕",2
2022-12-01,Too long and didn’t understand what was happening. Nearly fell asleep multiple times,2
2022-11-30,"twice i tried watching, twice i have fallen asleep.",2
2022-11-25,jared leto was in itwomen were treated like sh it everything for the male gazebut aesthetically : masterpiece,2

2022-10-21,That was shit,2
2022-10-19,Boring film but really good cinematography,2
,One of the most overrated films in recent years. Pure style over substance.,2
2022-10-14,The only two beautiful thing about this movie is the cinematography and Ana de Armas.,2
,Blood and boobs was all this movie was.,2
2022-09-25,i have fallen asleep multiple times trying to watch this film,2
2022-09-24,Jared Leto made it even worse,2
2022-09-22,i want to give this the benefit of the doubt like maybe it would've been more enjoyable in a theatre than on my laptop screen but this was a snoozefest.,2
2022-09-20,liked the visuals only,2
2022-09-19,probably my least favorite movie series ever,2
2022-09-13,horrible movie and this is not sigma people that actually think this is peak r weirdos who r ginger and have horrible haircuts,2

2022-08-01,Dormir muito chato,2
2022-07-28,hate this,2
2022-07-25,waste of my life.,2
,"I skipped the last half of the film, it's the first time a film bores me like this. Despite an incredible artistic direction the film is no less boring. The repetition of some interior sets despite the much more gripping outdoor sets in the universe makes the scenes really repetitive. Jared Leto bad as usual. Ryan Gosling plays a kind of robot so his acting is not to be complained about. The final twist is not bad as well as the message behind the film. Too bad the film is so boring.",2
2022-07-17,so bad i couldnt even finish it because i just didn’t care what happened,2
2022-07-15,Would have given it 2 stars if it's shorter,2
2022-07-14,"I feel like I would have cared a lot more about Gosling's character, who I actually thought acted beautifully, if this film wasn't as dragged out as it was. I do adore a good slow-paced film, but while this had interesting world design and stunning production design and cinematography to keep me somewhat engaged, I did lose interest. I think the pace matches Gosling's character's calm energy, but because he doesn't have a big personality to keep me entertained, I just lost interest. So yeah the story was dead on, but the telling I just thought could have been better",2
2022-07-13,if this movie was any slower i would've shot myself,2
2022-07-12,only rating it so low bc ana de armas wasn’t shown enough,2
2022-07-12,"it took everything in me to finish this, and i still couldn’t.",2
,CHATOO,2
2022-07-12,"i liked the cinematography, the music? fantastic. the colour grading? orgasmic. but like??? what was the point?? i understood the plot but i felt like it wasn’t really worth making the whole film yk",2
2022-07-09,why does everyone love this film so much?,2
2022-07-01,Pile of unbearable boring shit,2
2022-06-26,1 star purely because I love Ana de Armas- almost cried while watching this i was so upset.,2
,"props the cinematography, everything else meh",2
2022-06-21,subtracted 3 stars for having jared leto in it. otherwise it’s cool,2
,I was watching this like a tranquilized gorilla,2
2022-06-18,Why is neo noir so shit dear lord,2
2022-06-17,"“Ooh I can’t have food on the job ooh” girl stfu nobody caresI was gonna call him a loser for tryna date that robot but if would too if she looked like Ana de Armas oh also Jared Leto jumpscare Yeah sure I wasn’t paying attention, sue me.",2
2022-06-17,Switch it off after 40 mins.  Blah.,2
2022-06-15,it took everything in me to finish this,2
2022-06-05,two things: fanfic. and. twilight breaking dawn.,2
,boooorrrinngg so long feell asleep didnt like didnt watch the forst one,2
,Go on. Tell me my opinion's wrong. It just makes me stronger.,2
2022-05-26,"Genuinely one of the most boring movies i have ever watched, couldn’t even finish it and only watched half of the movie while having to take a shit ton of breaks because of how bored i was. so overrated 👎 giving one star is being generous and i guess some of the scenes are pretty BUT THATS ME BEING VERY VERY GENEROUS. Cyberpunk movies aren’t my type of thing so for all I know this could be a masterpiece🤷🏽",2
2022-05-24,absolute borefest. cinematography was really good though,2
2022-05-22,Sorry I fell asleep during this one too,2
2022-05-21,After watching this again the movie is bad…. The only thing that is working for the movie is visual effects,2
,Fuck this fancy piece of shit film. I walked out of the theatre with ~5 minutes left.,2
2022-05-16,I watched this at 9am,2
2022-05-15,i hate sci fi movies and I haven’t finished this yet either but this is so slow paced  I’ll come back when I finish,2
2022-05-10,suddenly my name is joe,2
2022-05-10,He edates..,2
2022-05-09,i adore the entire aesthetic & cinematography,2
2022-05-06,"although i haven’t seen the original blade runner, i can say for a fact that this is one of those times that a sequel or remake ruined the movie. the cinematography and score is amazing but the plot line is boring and frankly i was upset i wasted my time watching this. maybe i’m not snob enough to “get it” but this was a disappointment. i do love ana de armas though what a queen",2
2022-05-03,"the blades were only joggin, 1 star",2
,A beautiful looking film that is as pointless as it is boring.,2
,fell asleep watching this w my dad... SO PRETTY THO,2
2022-04-23,Lacking depth and development. Shameful movie had a lot of potential. Would’ve given 0 stars but the AI reminds me of my gf on discord.,2
,"Visually unpeered, some people do not like the pacing however I do, personally. The crew were able to make a well realized world and I find that the prolonged shots allowed me to really drink in the detail HOWEVER David Dastmalchian kind of reminds me of Paul Dano in a way and seeing him hurt evoked the same visceral feeling I get when I see Paul Dano get the absolute shit kicked out of him and it is just so.. painful to watch. 1 star.",2
2022-04-10,Boring and unitresting,2
2022-04-04,BRUH THE ONLY GOOD THING IN THIS MOVIE WAS ANA DE ARMAS.,2
2022-04-04,"Aside from the pretty colors, this was just mind-numbingly boring",2
2022-03-28,Somehow even worse than the original by being even more pointless and shallow. It was a good looking movie sometimes I guess? Dumbest premise I've ever heard of too. WHAT IF UHHHH harrison ford FUCKED robot girl...and had baby? Whoa. That's a thinker. Make sequel where almost nothing happens for 3 hours and then we reveal who the baby was! That's it!,2
2022-03-15,"This is a bad film. The soundtrack is dull and riddled with egregious fog horns, the characters are flat and impossible to engage with, the love story had all the passion and intensity of a slug hitting concrete, and the portrayal of women and poc is deeply uncomfortable. The backdrops might have impressed if they hadn't been dragged to centre stage in a doomed attempt to bolster a story that was too insubstantial for the 2hr+ running time. Roger Deakins'…",2
,Blade Runner and BR2049 are boring. I wish I could tell you why but I fell asleep.,2

2022-02-04,the one thing this movie gets right is that cops should only be allowed to date fake holographic people.,2
2022-02-04,I watched the full 2 hours and 40 minutes but I felt like I didn’t actually watch anything,2
2022-02-03,"the cinematography was top notch, but unfortunately this was not my kind of movie and i hated pretty much everything else about it. the score was interesting though.",2
2022-01-25,Didn't care for the first and had no connection with this one. It looks nice. Did nothing for me.,2
,"Visually this duology are two of the most attractive and visually engrossing films of all time, no one is going to dispute that and I want to get that off my chest first before I sh*t all over this. It is a very very very stunning film to look at. Ok, this is one of the most unnecessary sequels ever like why was this even made, it does nothing but retcon and over complicate previously established information from a classic…",2
2022-01-16,"The cinematography is absolutely the only commendable part of this movie. The sound mixing is horrendous; dialogue is barely audible, and often totally obscured by rumbling bass sound effects. There are awkward cuts in the editing which shift the tone abruptly and clumsily. Contrasting this is an over-abundance of long takes meant to build tension that is just not there. The pacing is atrocious. This movie had a budget north of $150 million. Why is the editing so bad??The…",2
2022-01-12,Too long and has nothing to tell. I was excited for the visuals but they were as boring as the script.,2

2021-12-28,"this is so bad i wanna give you a 0… but thats not possible, so i give you a 1 👍🏻",2
2021-12-27,maybe i’m just fucking dumb but this shit made 0 sense & i hated it. it felt pointless & nonsensical to me but to each their own. the visuals and cinematography were chefs kiss tho omfg🙏🏽,2
2021-12-24,"Couldn’t finish this, though I did push through one round of losing interest. I’ve got about half an hour left and I just don’t care. There were some cool special effects though.",2
,So… long… and… slow … for… so… little… story. You could have cut at least 45 minutes. Where was the world? I was quite let down after the praise for it. Netflix’s “Mute” was much deeper and more interesting.,2
2021-12-17,Denis Villeneuve thought he could force me to stare at all of his creepy wet dreams he shoved into this but he forgot one thing: I HAVE EYELIDS AND I KNOW HOW TO USE THEM,2
2021-12-11,genuinely shocked by how bad this was and i was rooting for it i really was,2
,"SNOOZEFEST. I am of the opinion that any sequel has to have a standalone compelling plot and this film, i say, DID 👏🏼 NOT 👏🏼HAVE 👏🏼 IT. I have seen hundreds of movies in my lifetime. I have left three movies in theaters halfway thru. This was one of them.",2
2021-12-05,Just because it’s beautifully shot doesn’t make it any less boring.,2
2021-12-02,i agree that the cinematography is absolutely spectacular but GOD this movie is boring. maybe i came into it with too high expectations but it let me down and then some. i couldn’t even finish it the first time i watched because i literally fell asleep.,2
2021-11-29,I can't. I simply can't. Villeneuve is definitely not for me.,2
2021-11-20,"Many extra scenes with no importance at all, and was able to transmit me depressive vibes for instances. It has a catchy plot though. Honestly not my type of movie.",2
2021-11-06,I know it’s an unpopular opinion but i just don’t like this film at all. You can’t substitute lack of narrative for visuals and assume that makes it a good film. It was ridiculously slow and Harrison Ford was barely in it. Not a scratch on the original.,2

2021-10-24,"Utterly, utterly awful piffle. This is what happens when a vast amount of money and time meets a a vacuum of talent, script and microphones.A witless plot, shamefully inaudible dialogue and a funereally slow directional pace. Ryan Gosling makes every scene a masterclass in looking confused, constipated or vacuous: or a combination of all three. Jared Leto does a weird pantomime villain routine or he may have had concussion on the way to the set. Harrison Ford is embarrassingly incoherent…",2

,this is a great start to the blade runner series cant wait till the next one comes out!!!!!!!!,2
2021-09-08,"Maybe I’m just a noob but this was extremely hard to watch, and I loved the first movie. Between the expressionless acting (yes I know why), the almost purely ambient soundtrack, sparse dialogue, self-indulgent 2.5h runtime, and weak characterization of everyone but the protagonist, this movie asks a lot of its audience. The pacing is fantastically sluggish, and I typically love slow atmospheric movies. Motivations and tension were vague at best so most scenes I wasn’t totally sure why anyone…",2
2021-09-04,i refuse to believe people actually like this movie,2

2021-08-13,This ponderous piece of shit. Most of my friends liked it and said I didn't get it but no one could explain what I didn't get. They said the sound quality was really great. Cool. Hated this.,2
2021-08-11,What the fuck was this movie about?? I’m not talking about plot I’m talking about what the actual point of this movie was. What was it about. This movie just meanders for 2 and a half hours and ends up having a generic plot about Deckards daughter being the key to some vague revolution. It adds nothing to the original and doesn't tell us anything new the absolute textbook definition of a failure. Also the cinematography is bland and replacing Johan Johannson with Hans Zimmer really should land someone in jail. I wish I liked more about this film but it’s just empty and boring.,2
2021-08-11,I was so excited about this one but the result was disappointing,2
2021-08-09,This is some Mickey Mouse in space bullshit,2
2021-08-01,Bland man. Yall can't ever get me invested in a Ryan Gosling performance. No matter how cool this movie looked. It's the death stranding of cinema.,2
,"even if it wasnt absurdly, cartoonishly sexist and so thematically empty, adding quite literally nothing to the original film, this is just a poor thriller that undercuts any possible excitement that might arise (his ship is about to be attacked?) with random happenstance non sequiturs (just kidding all the attackers got drone bombed out of nowhere). feels very much like someone watched the first movie and was like ""deckard just isnt cool and bad ass enough"". slowly feeling as though arrival was a fluke and villeneuve is just a bad director! also putting jared leto in anything is a crime in itself",2
2021-07-30,this movie made me suffer so much (not in the good way),2
2021-07-26,"I liked the first BR and thought it had an important story. I like some of Villeneuve’s work. But this is just trash. It’s typical big Hollywood blockbuster with no substance. Boring and superficial. The actors didn’t even seem engaged. It was obviously an easy paycheck and nothing more. For a movie that was so long awaited, with a decent story to go off of, they really dropped the ball on this one. Brand name bs and I’m sick of actors/actresses who get by on their looks.",2

2021-07-12,I know... I'm uncultured swine--but i don't care!! One of the most boring movies I've seen.... Other than the original. I mean cinematography obviously beautiful. The world building is good. Harrison Ford is still a dime piece. But i dislike everything else about it. It may make me crazy but this is on my hate list.,2

2021-05-06,"What a massive disappointment. Not only does it have nonsense story, awful dialogues, ridiculous characters, it also tarnishes the far superior story of the original movie and the masterpiece novel of Philip K.

2020-06-03,Confused as to how/why I liked this glorified car commercial back in 2017. Not looking forward to Dune anymore whatsoever.,2
,"I found it emotionally dead, and if I'm being honest, I don't trust those who say they felt anything other than boredom watching this. ",2
2020-05-07,what did I just watch?,2
2020-04-30,"This film just made me angry. I was stuck in a cinema not being able to escape from this nightmare. I really wanted good things from it, I really did. But the cast fell flat, the CGI was too sparky that I got a headache five minutes in and it just fell flat compared to the first one. I did however see it with a group of friends that enjoyed it. So I know my opinion is an unpopular one. ",2
2020-04-30,It looks great. That’s it.,2
,"Enjoyable for the first hour, and some pretty visuals throughout, it caves to the reboot fetish and hangs an incoherent plot on the audience’s presumed nostalgia for the first. Whereas franchises like Star Wars have banked on melodramatic nods to the originals, this film literally replays parts of the original. Also, Jared Leto and Harrison ford are (unsurprisingly) incredibly mediocre actors, but as few people recognise, so is Ryan Gossling.",2
,It was pretty cool until K wasn't the chosen one,2
2020-04-20,"loved the well written female characters in this movie, would like to see them one day",2
,What if a computer....knew he computer. ,2
,"There's a scene in this movie where someone gets stabbed in their office. In the moment of impact, Denis Villeneuve - cinematic charlatan of the decade - cuts outside the office window so that we the audience witness the stab and its immediate aftermath from a thousand feet in mid-air, with only the whistle of snowy wind on the soundtrack.",2
,Oh god spare me. Blade Runner 2049 takes all the bad things of Blade Runner and amps it up. This god awful writing and some of the most boring scenes just to build a plot that has no meaning what so ever.,2
,It's a gorgeous waste of time. Big Dave has the most nuanced performance of the film and after his scene you should pretend the movie is over and go do something else. Harrison Ford could not be convinced to get out of his fruit of the loom t-shirt and Jared Leto just kind of fucks off.,2
2020-04-09,Boring and pointless but it’s pretty I guess,2
2020-04-06,BooooOoooOoOoring! The original was way better / duh!Happy to Finally cross this one off my list !,2
2020-04-06,A hollow piece with great VFX and Sound.,2
,I don't care how good this director is (and he IS good). ,2
,Surprised Roger Deakins didn't blow his back out after CARRYING THIS MOVIE ON IT,2
2020-03-21,"A jumbled mess of a movie. At times, atmospherically cool film-making but the story seemed uninspired. I'm chalking this up as one of those ""Why'd they bother?"" sequels that we see way too many of these days.",2
2020-03-21,Spent the whole film waiting for it to end,2
,My favorite part of this movie is the bit where Ryan Gosling is doing the robot check-in and his left eye looks a full inch and a half lower than his right.,2
2020-03-02,Stupid Ryan Gosling being stupid as expected,2
2020-02-27,It just didn't click with me.,2

2019-12-29,"It should probably be noted I was never a huge fan of the original Blade Runner -- it dug hard into its noir inspiration, and, as with most noir, I found it to be emotionally predictable while pretending not to be. This sequel has the same problem for me. I just didn't care about anything in this world or this set up, I didn't care about Ryan Gosling, I didn't care about the evil corporation trying to make baby robots,…",2

2019-11-10,"The concept for this is very impressive considering it's a sequel to a film that didn't even leave room for one. K's core arc is original and powerful, definitely very relevant for modern society but also simply a resonant and universal struggle that is truly inspiring. On occasion, moments of real spiritual communication (like in the original Blade Runner) peak through, like the final scene or K on the bridge. These moments are very likely coming from Fancher, and are…",2
2019-11-08,Prime example of why men shouldn't be allowed to write their boring fucking excuse of sci-fi. Took me three days to get myself to watch this thing to the end and almost fell asleep.,2
2019-10-05,"Critics loved it, but the movie is boring. Anyway great to have Harrison Ford and Elvis Presley in one film.",2
2019-07-23,I got too drunk at this movie and fell asleep halfway. It’s cool that they gave Gosling a waifu. Dave Bautista needs bigger glasses.,2
,The film equivalent to putting your fingers in a hydraulic press,2
2019-07-02,"What the hell is this pretentious garbage? Three god damn hours of robot man being sad? I can't believe this is what passes as cinema nowadays. I've seen so many imbeciles moaning about how deep this pile of garbage is. Well here's the truth. It ain't. I will disclose that I bought the Blu Ray. As much as I hate this movie, I'll save money in the long run since I don't need to keep buying melatonin. Just pop this bad boy into my Xbox One and I'm out like a light.",2
,"Slow pace does not equal intelligence or depth, just boredom",2
2019-06-01,"i was initially excited to finally see the film on netflix after missing it in theatres when it premiered. the film is at times visually stunning, but so hollow, so slow, and so exploitative that it was an entirely joyless viewing experience for me.",2
,"I don't know quite what happened here but the appeal of the original Blade Runner got lost in translation somewhere. The visuals were nice, but for me the film failed to capture what I adored so much about the 1982 film.",2
2019-03-28,I sat down to watch this movie at 8pm and could not stay awake to save my life.,2

2018-08-16,"Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is an equally dull and boring yet visually appealing sibling of the 1982 Ridley Scott film, both of which basically have the same plot, same setting, and even the same characters to some extent, and which can only be completed watching with a struggle unless you doze off somewhere in the 31st minute, or if I want to sound pretentious like the film looks, the 49th minute. TN.",2
2018-08-05,This film is incredibly sexist and literally gave me PTSD sitting in the theater listening and watching. It makes no sense and doesn’t hold a torch to Blade Runner.,2
2018-07-16,Couldn’t have been more bored.,2
2018-06-18,"Oh, the anxiety of influence. You can never live up to the importance of that first film. Not that Denis didn't give it his best. The funny thing about the first was that so much of the branding was for products that no longer exist. It didn't stop Sony from putting its name all over this movie. Big budget, more commercials. The result is pretty pictures with absolutely no integrity.",2
2018-06-08,I watched this in the cinema and I fell asleep it was boring and quiet but thr colours were pretty,2
2018-06-02,just once i would like to watch a sci fi movie where all the women aren't sex robots and/or computer programs and/or evil,2
2018-06-02,Very slow (practically zero action) and runs at over 2 hours. Seems more of a movie to answer the question posed at the end of the first movie (theatrical cut) as to what happened to Deckard and Rachael.,2
2018-06-02,hands down one of the most boring movies i have ever seen. one of my friends passed out during the presentation in the cinema who recommended the movie to me and another friend who was also with us and also wanted to go after i said lets do smth else for like 3 times. he hated the movie aswell. its a bad movie. dont watch it.,2

2018-04-05,I have no attachment to anyone on board here so every issue this movie has with its treatment of women and minorities sticks out.,2
2018-03-25,"Best thing: The AI girlfriend was something I found interesting, particularly since the only difference between her and her Replicant user would seem to be her lack of a body. Any questions about her lack of humanity would also need to be asked about our protagonist played by Ryan Gosling.",2

2018-03-14,“Just look at the cinematography” naaaah m8 the movie is boring af,2
2018-03-02,Although most of you won't like my opinion: It is even more boring than the original Blade Runner.Some nice visuals.,2
2018-02-27,"I am a fan of the actual story by Philip K. Dick. This movie has no place in the Philip K. Dick universe.  I am offended that anyone thought they had the knowledge or understanding to expand on his story, “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?”",2

,"I’m a rarity because I hated the first the Harrison Ford “Blade Runner” from the 80s. I get it. I truly get the ground-breaking nature of it, the book’s source material being ahead of its time, and all that shit. Don’t @ me—It’s a terrible movie. I was tricked into seeing 2049 because the trailers made it look edgy and interesting, plus Ryan Gosling. WHAT 👏🏽 THE 👏🏽 HELL 👏🏽 Nope. I can’t hate this sequel enough. First of all, it was 45 minutes too long. Second of all, everything else.",2
2018-02-21,"i am in a room with denis villeneuve, excited to watch blade runner 2049. it is the 21st century, of course, so i hope it won't be as problematic or bland as the original — surely, we must have learned by now.",2

2018-01-30,Why hire Harrison Ford then give Ryan Gosling more screen time than him?I feel that a lot was left unexplained even with watching the prequel. Essential sub-plots weren’t explored at all and the ending was abrupt and unsatifying.,2
2018-01-26,i didn't know what was happening the whole time but it was pretty,2
2018-01-26,Waaaaaaaaaay too long. And slow. And drawn out. And pretty boring. And dreary. The one star is only because the filmography was spot on. Some movies though should never be made,2

,"I saw this movie months ago already. At first, I was too heated to write the review, so I pushed it off until my frustration with the film died down. However, midterms came along… then finals… and for some reason I haven’t gotten to the review until now. At least my sentiments toward the movie have (somewhat) mellowed out.",2
2017-12-01,"It was possible interesting but the movie dragged on for an unbelievably long time, to the extent that even the parts that I found initially interesting stopped being interesting by the time the movie ended. Maybe it's my problem for having no attention span though",2
2017-11-19,"This movie broke me. I was angry laughing an hour in when the camera zoomed in on Ryan Gosling's forehead for the 1000th time. The acting was annoying, the pacing was atrocious, and the plot was just not good. I had to leave the theater multiple times to sit in the bathroom HOPING it would be over by the time I returned. The it was never over. The one star is exclusively a nod to the decent visuals. Stylistically it was interesting.",2
2017-11-16,"The biggest disappointment ever on a movie that had all the right players to win yet didn't make it. Here's why. Denis Villeneuve is a great director. I loved Sicario and most of his films. Hans Zimmer is a pretty good composer, or at least a serious one. The shots are amazing. And although it might be beautiful to look at, the script and editing fail miserably.",2

2017-10-14,This movie is a misogynistic dystopian mess.,2
2017-10-13,The story is meandering. The way they depict women and POC goes from shallow to outright horrible throughout the movie. Apologists may blame the original that came out in 1982 or the genre but this rings lame in 2017. About five of the top ten characters don’t need to exist. The “chosen one” is not developed at all and we waste 40 minutes searching for K’s identity. Why is Jared Leto in this movie? One of my friends said that Ryan Gosling’s acting style was “Keanu Reaves without facial expressions” I think that nails it. But hey it looks good. This movie makes me angry.,2
2017-10-12,The second star this movie could have gotten for all its visual elements is taken right back off by everything else about it.The root of my biggest problems with Denis Villeneuve's deeply unnecessary sequel to Ridley Scott's genre classic is that it retains screenwriter Hampton Fancher.Fancher was responsible for the insidious misogyny in the first film and with a new decade comes an even bigger dose of that bullshit.Stop reading this sentence here if you don't want…,2
2017-10-11,"Blade Runner 2049 is to Blade Runner what Star Wars: The Force Awakens is to Star Wars. What slowly starts out as a quiet, small journey of discovery quickly devolves into an epic miscalculation that ultimately equals nothing. Propelled by an unhealthy misconception of what the original Blade Runner was—which is a grimey, intimate meditation on desolation and loneliness—, Blade Runner 2049 meanders on majestically like an orchestra without a conductor.

2017-10-05,A 165 min movie comprised of scenes of Ryan Gosling walking VERY SLOWLY down corridors while admiring art deco sets filmed gorgeously by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins.

2024-02-13,"Denis Villeneuve really swept me off my feet with PRISONERS, ENEMY, and ARRIVAL. But my hot take of the week is that he's not actually a very good filmmaker. With the three forementioned films, it's really the writing that makes them great. But lesser screenplays betray Villeneuve's lack of talent. All his films look (and sound) the same. That's not necessarily an issue, all Leone's films look the same too. But the difference is Villeneuve's films look like shit. The…",3

2023-01-09,Shit film.Marginally better than the first (first film gets 0/5). Which is saying something because the first one could send an insomniac to sleep. Would only recommend this film as a replacement for night nurse. Only gave it a 1.5/5 cos the cgi in this one is pretty good.

First is human, then not and the later yes and so on and so on.",3
2022-09-06,"Incredibly visually pleasing with lovely VFX and cinematography, but I felt largely disconnected from the story and didn’t feel attached to any characters.

,"I had to watch this for an ethics assignment in high school. We could choose from a wide range of topics, but most had chosen ai ethics. Our teacher was a huge fan of the original Blade Runner. That explains that, I guess. Well, 2049 wasn't on any streaming service at the time, so I got a used blu ray and had all these classmates I had never interacted with outside of school over at my house. This film is incredibly long. It really was a chore. But we kinda bonded a little over this experience.",3
2022-08-27,Gonna be honest… I only watched this cause I kept seeing it in those film bro tiktoks but this movie was actually sm better than I expected it to be,3

2022-07-19,Visually stunning but utterly boring. Ryan Gosling delivers a performance that I’d expect Michael Owen to produce. Due to the absolute dullness of the characters I end up getting to the end of the movie with absolutely 0 idea what’s going on as I had been drifting off to sleep the whole time. I don’t understand the hype around this film and the original blade runner. Not for me.,3
2022-07-11,"Very philosophical themes throughout, but I did not like the dialogue very much, and I had to stop watching when Jared Leto came onto the screen",3
2022-07-09,There is no reason for a movie to be nearly three hours long. I paused it at one point to take my dog outside and I was over an hour in and still had over an hour and a half left. There's no reason to watch over an hour of a movie and still have a full length movie to go. ,3

2022-06-02,"Usually when I don’t like a movie, I don’t think much about it. I move on. But Blade Runner 2049 clearly considers itself an exceptional movie - an auteur’s epic look into what it means to be human, artistically shot and told as a noir sci-fi mystery. So after I slogged through its dragging scenes and robotic performances, I felt cheated by its own arrogance and the expectations instilled in me by the generally rave reviews it received. ",3

I’ve raised my rating by a whole star because Sylvia Hoeks is good, but sadly wasted on this emotionally tone-deaf picture. People need to get out more I guess. All the praise for this flat cinematography is absurd. It’s pretty, but nowhere near as sublime as Cronenweth’s original.",3
2021-12-09,A very unnecessary sequel with bad dialogue. (The old Blade Runner is one of the best cyberpunk movies!) I liked the brutalist cityscapes and some of the imagery in this one tho. Also funny that Peugeot and Coca Cola are a thing in 2049 xd,3
2021-12-01,Denis Villneuve is the most indulgent director I've seen. ,3
2021-11-27,The visuals and the acting were good but the story was awful. Deckard and Rachel were brought back for no reason when it would have made sense to use different characters. Jared Leto plays the most forgettable villain I've ever seen. Ryan gosling's character k was alright but his arc only works if he's the stupidest motherfucker ever.,3

The actual story is either confusing or too straight forward and there are basic points that if doesn't explain which would really need to be made clear. I never got the actual basics of the replicants. Are they just like humans or no? I guess they are except for strength and they can't lie? AI is seemingly absent except for the replicants. It's odd that they had to eat.Pretty sure Harrison Ford was allowed to just show up and didn't have to change clothes. He effortless in his role but is he acting at all?,3

2023-12-29,hum. i wanted something with the graphics of a grimes song. vaporwave 2016. i guess i got that. the storyline was unbeatably slow. no need for it to be 3 freaking hours. ,4
2023-12-28,i too believe i am more important than i actually am,4
2023-12-27,Overrated as f*ck,4
2023-12-27,we all got really confused by the end of the film and there wasn’t really much of a plot either. but I gave this rating bc it did have some good actors/actresses in it.,4

2023-12-23,"Just no comprehension of what happened. Need to watch the series I think, but still relatively emotional and grade A Gosling performance",4
,brilliant visuals that couldnt make up for the plot,4
2023-12-21,A lighting seminar but the story is without soul. Gosling aimlessly wandering around in a world which doesn't have the original's vibe. Not a real threat (Leto's role as a bad guy is a joke) anywhere and I simply don't care if Ford ever finds his lost child.,4

I’ll admit, I’m not an action movie person, so I’m biased, but I thought the world building and cinematography were pretty much the only redeeming qualities. I consider myself at least SOMEWHAT an intellectual but I was ~confused~. Maybe I should’ve watched the other movies first BLAH BLAH BLAH whatever I didn’t really like it.",4

The first Blade Runner is my favorite movie of all time so at first I didn't know what to think of 2049. I tried to appreciate it but that didn't really work. Let me start with the visual aspect of 2049. For films shot on digital, this is not bad, to be honest. As a Blade Runner film, this looks rather…",4

2023-12-11,"A sequel is, by its very nature, derivative. But the fact that there’s nothing “original” about BLADE RUNNER 2049 — especially compared to its progenitor, which is essentially groundbreaking in every way — isn’t what makes the film a miss for me. “Originality” is overrated in my opinion anyway (for one, it’s entirely dependent on context — what’s original to one person might be something someone else has seen a hundred times — and for another, there’s no carbon dating…",4

2023-11-30,"Of the remakes and sequels produced in recent memory, this is one of the most unnecessary. It accomplishes little, barks platitudes at the audience, repeats itself at an increasing frequency as the end approaches, and features less than stellar writing.

2023-10-29,I literally had no idea what was going on the entire time,4
,Denis Villeneuve's work seems to be put-off for me. The aesthetic fails to match the magic of this film's predecessor. The seedy elements of the original Blade Runner feel as though they've been turned into a catwalk show cum designer flat for this one.,4

2024-06-12,"Was not expecting that much gore or that kind of ending at all, but still a great movie. The driving scenes are so immersive and interesting, and Ryan’s acting in this is so good.

2024-06-12,"Drive is meh. Ryan Gosling’s acting is strangely monotone. A lot of violence happens for seemingly no reason to me.

On first watch he can feel robotic or soulless but it’s abundantly evident that there is a full world inside. His eyes say so much.,9

2024-06-11,Loved the aesthetic and the style of film. Music choice is nostalgic an the dialogue and acting is something unique compared to movies of recent times. Director really does story telling in a visual way whether the actors expressions or the scenes of the movie.,8

2024-06-11,I think Ryan gosling is becoming my Roman Empire why his character in movies make me so in love he so mysterious yet sweetie pie,10

2024-06-11,Make sure your volume isn’t to loud or you will be scared.,9
2024-06-10,Ryan Gosling is as good here as he has ever been. I think I’d put a few that came after this above it but this shows he has great range in a quiet but commanding performance. He has a strong chemistry with Carey Mulligan and the slow but methodical way their relationship develops is a strength of the movie. It’s also packed with a ton of quality supporting performances and strong violence.,9
2024-06-10,"Well tbh I didn’t think it would be that good, was expecting it to be a bit crappy cause of the meme, but was actually a great film. Great cast, great music, great story. Ryan g literally me tho",9

I’m such a sucker for slick stylized movies and this one goes so hard with it.

2024-06-09,"My mouth was dry the entirety of this movie because it stressed me out in a very compelling way. Ryan Gosling has very tiny ears. I never noticed that before this movie, but that's probably why Baby Driver is so different. Ryan Gosling can't fit earbuds into his ears.",8

2024-06-07,Rewatching films currently with a more advanced mindset is something special and brings out a sense of appreciation that you cannot help but enjoy. It was practically brand new & fresh in my mind upon viewing this after so long and holds up greater than before. It utilizes visual storytelling in great fashion and is slow paced but contains clever symbolism while conveying a unique tone with its riveting neo-noir atmosphere. Ryan Gosling is shrouded in mystery and excellently portrays the…,9
2024-06-08,i really like the way they cut almost all of driver’s lines. the character is so interesting. carey mulligan is fantastic. i think i said this in one of my last reviews but i still get annoyed w how on the nose several songs on the soundtrack are. nightfall. under your spell. a real hero. whatever.,8

2024-06-07,"Ok this one is a doozy. I was gobsmacked by the pre-title sequence. Instantly one of my favorite openings ever. And it just kept going. The romantic gazes and gentle smirks. The stylish camera moves. The iridescence of LA, captured wonderfully. The heavy hitting cast of supporting characters, all played with gusto. THE MUSIC. That elevator scene.",10

2024-06-07,"Ofc we are back with another Ryan Gosling movie and this was a little underwhelming but still a good movie with all things considered.

The first hour or so seems to have little to no action whereas the back half of the movie is stacked with it. The fact that…",6

2024-06-07,"Idk how I’ve never seen this before, glad to finally strike it off the list. Such a satisfying story told so simply, it’s pretty inspiring to see how much they were able to accomplish within the budgetary constraints. I thought all of the performances were great, Ryan gosling totally fit into the bad ass persona. I will say it very suddenly became bloody and violent which is great the set pieces like the hammer are iconic for a reason. It just felt a little bit extreme, not out of nowhere but definitely unexpected and I’m not sure how I feel about it.",8

2024-06-07,"More comedic than serious, the quiet, edgy, but kind-hearted dark hero didn't quite sit well with me. Devoid of a personality, relationship with no chemistry and completely built on longing looks, am I supposed to believe they're in love? A bunch of nonsensical scenes that end up being goofy in retrospect. A couple of cool action scenes, but that's about it. Oscar Isaac is completely wasted in this film, but Gosling was pretty good!

2024-06-05,"It's a testement to Ryan Gosling's incredible talent that he was able to make the Driver--a fundamentally creepy and unlikeable character--so compelling, sympathetic, and even charming. He exudes the perfect combination of innocence and edge, of calm and aggression, of vulnerability and strength. Honestly, I think Gosling might be the best actor of his generation, give or take a The Gray Man (nobody's perfect).",10

2024-06-06,"Feels like a prequel to The Fall Guy, great action and story. Love some Mob action, Gossling’s quiet/shy guy performance is wonderful.",8

2024-06-06,This ended up being a movie that went down a path I was not expecting. The deaths were so creative!,7
2024-06-06,Just as you think it’a a slow movie with nothing going on - everything EXPLODES!,7
2024-06-05,"This was phenomenal in every sense of the word. Yes, it's a bit of a surprise that I hadn't seen it — I can't believe it's been 13 years since this was released, I owned a Blu-ray (didn't watch it), then even found a cheap copy of big, fancy Second Sight 4K UHD set and bought it (still didn't watch it, didn't even unwrap from shrink). I was thinking I might flip that set — it goes for over $200…",10
2024-06-06,he whipped that fr 🔥,9
2024-06-06,OMFG this was incredible new favorite Ryan Gosling movie AHH omg it was INCREDIBLE,10
2024-05-28,"It’s definitely different, and I respect it for that.",6
2024-06-06,Some nice scenes with good acting. A bit slow at points but overall an enjoyable film.,8
2024-06-06,"god forbid I ever anger stepdad ryan gosling, this was insane",9
2024-06-06,That ending had me STRESSING,9
2024-06-06,i didnt really felt anything while watching it,5
2024-06-06,Hadn’t watched this since it came out and wanted to revisit it. Pretty good. Ryan Gosling doesn’t really act a lot in this. I’ve been told that’s the point but I don’t see it.,7
2024-06-06,"""one last score"" type of movie. Just watch baby driver instead and ignore ansel elgorts acting",6

2024-06-04,"Even better than I remembered. This movie is so beautifully shot. I love the color palette. The music. The style. Gosling exudes cool. Los Angeles is really put on display, which is always a bonus for me.",9
2024-06-06,"Ryan Gosling is simply “The Driver”. The only two things he needs are a steering wheel, and a trip to the DIY section. This was exceptionally 13 years ago, and it’s still exceptional now.",10
2024-06-06,"“Imagine he just randomly blinks and starts up the car, driving off in the distance” I need to write movies fr 💆🏾",8
2024-06-06,ryan gosling did indeed drive in this movie,7
2024-06-06,Unexpectedly Brutal. But anok Movie all in all,5
2024-03-23,"watched it cus ryan gosling (obviously),but it was so dreamy and cinematic I absolutely loved it",9
2024-06-06,"Not a personal favourite, bumped the rating up because I drive.",8
2024-06-06,"Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, Drive is an absolute thrill of a movie. Not only is the cast great, such as: Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, and Bryan Cranston, but the music score and overall feel of the movie is superb.It’s an interesting story that has some twists and turns, is full of tension, and sprinkles in a bit of romance as well. So I’d suggest you buckle up, put the car in Drive, and hit the gas. This is one hell of a ride.4.5/5: Lovely amount of Ryan Gosling ",9
2024-06-06,"Arguably my favorite movie of all-time, not arguably the greatest soundtrack in modern cinema. This movie introduces a detached, cold, calculated driver and follows his arc of falling in love, wanting out of a life of crime, trying to reconcile his dissonance, but like the scorpion, against his own self-interest, he ultimately succombs. Winding Refn uses beautiful cinematography, near perfect story telling, and engaging framing techniques to maximize the fantastic performance of Gosling. No words are wasted, no scene is unnecessary, just an expertly paced neo-noir masterpiece.",9
2024-06-05,"I walked into this movie completely blind, the extent of my knowledge being that he, well, Drives™️",9
2024-06-06,Less cool driving than I was expecting. As in not much of it and not as cool as I wanted.,6
2024-06-05,"I really expected more out of Drive, given how many folks' brains it seems to have completely rewired. It wears its varied influences on its sleeve. Not an inherent issue, but I found it never reached the escape velocity of those movies' orbits, and left me wanting to watch them instead. I also chafed against the soundtrack, which does so much heavy lifting.",6
2024-06-06,"Incredible thriller. Tense from the opening scene. Ryan Gosling was amazing. Perhaps his best performance, using his eyes to do a lot of the work. ",10
2024-06-06,"the most annoying guy you know is gonna write a review like ""he just like me fr""",6
2024-06-05,if unspoken rizz was a feature length film,6

2020-10-29,yes that's for sure me but I don't remember filming this! 🤨,10
2024-06-06,"That Carey Mulligan smile is so infectious. I love her.Ryan Gosling is also too good in playing these flawed character. Just like Blade Runner with the hologram, he bonds with an unexpected character, this time a single mom whose husband is in prison. His motivations to protect them come from a place of longing where he has to overcome his loneliness. Was wonderful seeing Christina Hendricks here from Mad Men; one of the best TV shows in existence 😮‍💨, also Bryan Cranston although and Oscar Isaac.Imma rewatch this.",8

2024-06-05,Watched for the plot (ryan gosling),4
2024-06-05,"Second viewing, and first on the big screen. Really rocks on Alamo's biggest screen, not just the picture quality but especially the sound design: the guns here are probably the loudest I've heard since HEAT? Anyway, probably Gosling's best dramatic performance, one which uses his physicality and nice guy looks to hide something much darker. MUCH, much darker. Love how the first half is all character building before the frantic, ultraviolent second half, and how Refn deploys that ultraviolence at…",10
2024-06-05,Good. Unexpected. Ambiguous.,8

2024-06-06,i heard Ryan's dialogue coach was a mute,9
2024-06-05,"Good, but overrated. ",8
2024-06-06,This makes me wanna buy driving gloves but then I'm reminded I'm not as cool as Ryan Gosling,8
2024-06-05,"Someone tell the filmbros to pick a better movie please, this just doesn't have much value past the shock of an initial watch",5
2024-06-05,Ryan gosling invented the look of yearning,8
2024-06-05,1 hour and 40 minutes of Ryan Gosling wearing a silver bomber jacket.,8
2024-06-05,"Move out the way Baby Driver, Daddy Driver is here. Also if this was made today, Vroom Vroom by Charli XCX would be the theme 💯",10
2024-06-05,Ryan Gosling just straight up left those heist guys in that parking garage with all the cops around but then the synth hit and I was like oh fuck you right,9
2024-06-05,This is just the sickest movie of all time. SO MUCH SAUCE.,10
2024-06-05,"This story actually makes so much less sense than I remember it making, but the last time I saw it in theaters I was sitting five feet away from them-Vice President Joe Biden (he told me he liked it when I asked) so maybe I wasn’t paying attention as much as I should have been.",9
2024-04-19,"ryan renolds is him, unspoken (autistic?) rizz, good morals, always for the children",7
2024-06-05,Girlie was pulling the absolute hottest criminals in LA with her lil bob. Lots of gory eye covering scenes if you’re one of those (I am.) Love to see miss Christina Hendricks pop up! ,7
2024-06-05,68/100(was a 64/100),7
2024-06-05,"I cannot believe I forgot that Drive (2011) is a masterpiece. The last time I saw this movie was about 12 years ago, but it truly felt timeless on this rewatch. Refn created something really special with this film.",10
2024-06-05,Look…I’ve been down bad for a crush before too…but this is out of hand!,10
2024-06-05,"The vibe of this movie is great, from the 80’s inspired music to the scorpion jacket and the silent protagonist. Unfortunately, the actual content of the film is greatly lacking. The Miami Vice inspiration falls flat in the modern setting, the action is too contained to be memorable, and the story is both predictable and unremarkable. Drive was a good enough one-time watch, and Ryan Gosling plays his character well (though the character’s appeal to young men is worrying), but…",6
2024-06-05,"well paced, stylish and full of potency.",8
2024-06-05,i need to breathe in the air these actors shared,9

2024-06-05,Get to see one of my favorite movies of all time in the theater and I loved it of course. Hearing the soundtrack/score over loud speakers and seeing all the neon colors on a big screen gives me joy. Ryan Gosling could be one of the coolest actors of our generation.,10

2011-10-27,Enjoyed and annoyed.,6
2024-06-05,First time seeing this since I was like 13. Like it way more than I did when I first saw it and I still have memories of almost purchasing the scorpion jacket.,8

2024-06-05,You cannot convince me this is a movie.,4
2024-06-05,Ryan Gosling is a super hero. His power is drive. He activate by squeezing fist very tight. His cape is scorpion jacket and little gloves. Wow,9

2024-06-05,Gosling is great. Isaac was fun for the brief time he was in it. Violent. Not much for resolution.,7
2024-06-06,This is a cool film that you must watch because of the person who saves a family.,9
2024-06-06,hey look! pretty neon lights with a synth soundtrack playing in the background (they are coated in brain matter and depressing thoughts),8
2024-06-06,"''Drive"" is a film about the Soft and the Hard co-existing in its characters. This genre film might be about style, but its characters are walking contradictions and thus 3-dimensional. ",10

You might say the movie is based on effects rather than the story, but this is for me  could be one of the best neo-noir moving of the decade.Protagonist's appearance is from the beginning really as he is hiding his real romantic and sensitive personality hidden in a cold body of a criminal whose heart was warmed up by a touch of beautiful Carey Muligan.",8

Not to mention the fact that he basically just drives around California so I’m wondering if that counts. Also, there’s a family that’s apart of this film. But overall I this was such a great movie.

2024-05-30,"Honestly, it was a very enjoyable movie, though it was a much slower pace than I was expecting, and hoping for. Ryan Gosling's acting as Driver was amazing, and he played the character well. Its quite a shocking difference between his character in Barbie (Ken), which I had seen before this.There were several moments where I expected one thing, but something else entirely happened! It's hard to shock me like that (sometimes), but over all it was an enjoyable movie.I wouldn't watch it again though.",6

So stylish, so cool, incredibly tense, the music great, the cinematography too, it’s all amazing. I’m just rambling here.

2024-05-30,Still so great but was nobody going to tell me I literally have the exact same car as him. Like at the start when he does the first heist with what was apparently the “most common car in California” in 2011 it’s the exact same colour model and year as my 2007 Impala. Even the interior is the exact same except the seats are leather and mine are fabric but we have the same stereo and tacky wooden finish on the dash & everything that’s so crazy um so imagine that’s me when u watch that scene,9

Maybe it was a lower budget or maybe they did exactly what they wanted to do and I just wasn’t the right audience, but in the end, it was a pretty alright movie. Ryan Gosling is pretty cool. :)",6

2024-05-30,"You would think all the long pauses and slow fades would make the pacing unbearably sluggish, but it somehow accentuates the violence and adds to the mood. Sure, the dialogue is a tad anemic and half the cast members basically just mumble their lines. But how can I NOT love a movie when it so perfectly captures the effortless cool and undeniable romance of neo-noir cinema?",10
2024-05-30,speak up a bit please 🙏,6
2024-05-29,8.9I really loved the mood of the movie. I enjoyed Ryan Gosling’s character and not being able to pinpoint his true motivations until the very end. The gorey action really surprised me and switched the tempo of the movie up a lot which I really enjoyed too. Literally me.,8
2024-05-29,"So little is spoken in this film but so much is said by it. A big fan of this, possibly one of Ryan gosling most ‘I am him’ performance.",9
2024-05-30,I can't imagine how psychologically devastating it must have been for Carey Mulligan to spend all day with Ryan Gosling and his lovely jacket and then have to go home to that Mumford guy and his stupid banjo.,6
2024-05-30,such a stunning cinematic feast.,10
2019-04-22,"The opening scene is legendary, the music is awesome, the action scenes are great and Ryan Gosling in that legendary scorpion jacket is fucking epic.",10
2024-05-30,I CANT TAKE IT SERIOSULY IM SORRY idk what it is maybe the music or I was distracted but I was just laughing the whole time and it was so cringe I love Ryan Gosling but I just couldn't take it seriously. When the blonde girl slapped him HAHAHHA ill rewatch it some time I'm not distracted,4
2024-05-29,Drive walked so baby driver could run. Ryan gosling being a sexy simp who doesn’t talk.,7

2024-05-30,This movie felt different from other movies. The random brutal scenes of violence were very unexpected but did a lot in telling about the a lot about the driver,10
2024-05-30,"Colt Seavers had a heck of an origin story, wow.",7
2024-05-30,"I was sucked in at the opening scene, epic music and a car chase? Sign me up. The main character says very little, but Ryan Gosling conveys so much through his eyes and facial expressions. He is truly an incredible actor. I will say I was left wishing I knew more about the driver...but I am just now realizing (after a google search) that his name is ""Driver"" so I guess that was on purpose. In conclusion: I am on a mission to watch all of Ryan Gosling's films and weep.",7

2024-05-29,ryan gosling they could never make me hate you,10
2024-05-29,"Drive is one hell of a cool film. The soundtrack is stellar, its plot is emotional, the chase scenes are impressively exhilarating, and Ryan Gosling’s performance depicts one of the most badass characters I’ve seen. A seemingly calm, cool, and collected guy implodes and viscously defends his love. The atmosphere the film places its viewers in is spectacular. And if asked to define aura I’d show a picture of this film.",9

2024-05-30,"I mean.. soundtrack, Gosling, and some of the action sequences were nice af, however it lacked a lot of depth, it felt like they were just trying to fill time with these long silence looks, and the whole mob thing + the idea that he was supposed to be turned into a car racer was just tossed in the trash. I expected better honestly nearly fell asleep.",6
2024-05-29,Why was Nemo’s dad such an asshole?,8
2024-05-29,"Bless Gosling and that toothpick—more expressive than most actors. Also, Refn’s choice of silence in this film is so loud, it should get its own dialogue credit. Enjoyed more than expected.",8
2024-05-29,"The things that make The Driver look so cool and edgy are some of the corniest shit I’ve seen, but it still works for me. I think the way the violence was stylized felt so out of place but the elevator scene still rocks.",6
2024-05-29,Top top,10
2024-05-29,"I'm not entirely sure why so many people love this movie. A good chuck of the film is conveyed through 'meaningful' looks because 'its not what said, but what isn't said' - but how are we supposed to connect with the characters if they barely say anything and retain a constant emotionless look. There were too many weird silences which were portrayed as endearing and edgy. This movie has reminded me of why I'm not much of a fan of…",5

2024-05-28,Drive is entertaining but falls so short in a lot of different aspects. The dialogue drones and Goslings identity is kind of all over the place to the point where it's annoying and not clever. ,6

I thought he was great here in the limited screen time he received, but Ryan Gosling really steals the show. Partly because he is so unbelievably handsome, and partly because he was able to do so much without many lines. The soundtrack was great and the action sequences were awesome. I wasn't sure with how filmbro-y it is and how much hype surrounds it that I would love this film, but I did.",9

Refn shoots this like a fever dream music video where everything endless fades in each-other, music overdrives everything and the violence is cold to the point of cartoon like. It lacks the rough charm everything up to Bronson had but him endless playing with the lighting on the sun bleached sets, this is way less neon covered then I…",8

The first interactions between Driver and Irene are fantastically acted with subtlety. The chases are great. The two sides of Driver, and a sense of a good man doing bad things for what he sees as good reasons. One of the great anti-heroes. Oh yeah and its also literally me.",10

2024-05-28,*insert a joke about the gas prices in this economy*,9
2024-05-27,A unique action movie with strong performances and a generally reserved tone that unleashes itself pretty effectively when it needs to. The music is immaculate and creates a vibe unlike any other movie I’ve seen. I feel like this movie would only be half as good if the main character wasn’t Ryan Gosling as without his charisma some of the scenes would just feel awkward.,8
2024-05-28,the elevator scene was so pretty ,8
2024-05-24,"Peak cinema. Even though the movie is already very popular, I think Drive is still a bit underrated. Perfect acting, a captivating story and the brilliant combination of great music and beautiful images make this movie an experience every time.",10

2024-05-28,Hmmm.. This man is so familiar to me.,7
2024-05-28,he’s literally me; a stoic loner badass (socially-challenged weirdo) who ends up befriending (stalking) a cute girl (i'm scared of women).,10
,"One of those films where not much is happening and is simply carried by frame shots and neon visuals, but what makes its own thing is Gosling's apathetic performance. However, this apathy allows you to recognize what the characters are going through, and see how their actions are their way of surviving the lives they choose. It never tries to be something it's not because it wasn't anything in the first place; it just is.",8

2024-05-27,To stare blissfully into Ryan Goslings eyes while he wears denim on denim,8
2024-05-27,This movies performances are subtle but powerful at the same time. You care for Driver and Irene as soon as they meet each other and want that to work even though you’re rooting for Standard and his family at the same time. Both Oscar Isaac and Bryan Cranston were amazing in their roles for the limited amount of time they were on screen.,9
2024-05-27,Big couple of days for movies about driving. I really liked how this started but towards the end it lost me. Felt like a student film with a budget,7
2024-05-28,"Oh man, I really liked this film. Now I understand all those sigma male autistic afraid of women alpha edits about Ryan Gosling in this movie.",9

2024-05-28,"Non verbal, autistic Ryan Gosling taking down the mafia single handedly is fucking sick. Also wicked sound track and camera shots and I like when movies are just straight up violent and this dose scratch that itch. Overall pretty cool movie Ryan Gosling got black air force energy fr fr",8

2024-05-27,"I described Fall Guy to my parents as a hybrid between Ken and Driver, so we watched Drive, of course.",9
2024-05-27,"I didn’t realize how deep this cast was Albert Brooks, Ron Pearlman, Christina Hendricks, Oscar Isaac…not to mention Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan and Bryan Cranston.",8
2024-05-27,"I hate movies that end in a draw, & this is a particularly offensive claim to that. But it’s an entertaining watch.",6
2024-05-27,"highkey got so bored watching this. by the time we reached the “job gone wrong” plot point i was so over it and didn’t have any care for what happened to the characters. driver is so quiet, and i get that it’s his character, but it made his interaction with everyone, irene especially, feel so awkward.",2
2024-05-27,Convinced that Ryan Gosling's script direction was just punctuation marks,8
2024-05-27,Yup. He drives.,9
2024-05-22,He’s literally me,10
2024-05-27,I thought this movie was gonna be sigma,2

2024-05-28,He is just a driver and drive Emotions 🙂,6
2024-05-28,I really feel like that I need to praise this movie in all areas. It is actually a PERFECT movie. I don't say this often. I know that I might brag under a few beers about everything from JAWS to the GODFATHER. This movie has a perfect cast that is grounded perfectly in their roles with some of the actors playing against type. ,10
2024-05-26,"The lack of dialogue and emphasis on “emotional looks” was kinda cringey, but Ryan gosling does great as simp John Wick",8
2024-05-27,"Ryan Gosling, a real hero...",8
2024-05-27,the gosling effect is alive and real,8
2024-05-27,but he’s just ken???? also love the fact that ryan goslings character never gets a name throughout the whole moviei feel like i gotta watch again as i think i missed a couple things but yeah not a bad watch,7
2024-05-27,ALL 5 STARS FOR THE SOUNDTRACK AND RYAN GOSLING YDJJYDJXXKH,10
2024-05-27,Family friendly version of taxi driver 👍,8
2024-05-27,"HOLY SHIT WHAT A TIME TO BE DEPRESSED, last day in LA and a local theater was showing this film close to me so i took the car no hesitation and drove alone to watch it since my parents knew this whole week ive been depressed. I love this movie and with how im feeling right now, I ADORE this movie even more. It was so worth it since I had the whole place to myself and i enjoyed every…",9
2024-05-27,Song choice was perfect and I guess Ryan gosling has a more broad acting range than I thought. I definitely didn’t expect the movie to be as gory as it was. Overall good movie. Lesson here is don’t help people. You might die.,7
2024-05-27,"I thought this was pretty rubbish guys, I gotta be true",5
2024-05-26,"Sometimes I’m like damn what gorgeous filmThis time around I’m more like ew why can’t he just fucking SPEAK UP and the PAUSES. THE FUCKING PAUSES. JUST SAY IT ALREADY. God i got so frustrated and cringed out this watch around…but it’s still such a vibe…Plot great, story great, characters solid, delicious score. Dialogue total garbage and it bothered me a lot. Still recommend watching 👍",7
2024-05-27,"It’s a story about fighting the person you are and working towards the person you want to be. It acknowledges the good, the bad, and the ugly that exists within Driver; but, the story is about Driver becoming a hero in his own way, by directing his bad and ugly actions toward the good end of saving Irene and Benicio. A flawed, but redeemable hero. Or, as the theme song suggests, “a real human being.”",7
2024-05-27,"Bro, its literally a film of me, i forgot when they film me",10
2024-05-26,"This is a very good movie and recommended. Before the Fall Guy, Ryan Gosling played a part time Hollywood stunt driver in Drive. We don't know his character's backstory - all we know is he is an expert driver and mechanic. It reminded me a bit of Gosling's The Place Beyond the Pines where he played a similar character. Gosling plays the part well and is helped by a strong supporting cast of Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac, Christina…",7
2024-05-28,this guy has so much plot armour jesus christ ,8

2024-05-27,For the night warm,8
2024-05-27,"Man the first time I tried watching Drive like 2-3 years ago I dropped it since it was too slow for me back then, thank god I have grown up to be normal. When I think about Drive and look at my notes what gets around a lot is just subdued or restrictive which I feel perfectly could describe this movie in one word if you had to. Im honestly kinda impressed with how little they use their amazing soundtrack…",8
2024-05-27,I’m literally him,8
2024-05-24,"i understand the hype,lots of violence,very bro dude.",8

,Can't say anything bad about this movie great soundtrack great acting,10
2024-05-26,"Ryan Gosling AND Oscar Isaac!?every song in this film sounds like it was made to be on the soundtrack, now I need to go listen to it again…minus star for never washing that jacket",8
2024-05-11,"Hard to believe this film is over ten years old now but it still holds up and like a fine wine it has gotten better with age. Gosling is amazing and then puts on an acting clinic with his delivery of minimal dialogue and his on screen presence. The writing, directing and cinematography are great as well as the acting from the supporting cast. That’s failing to mention the fact that this has a near perfect soundtrack to accompany this near perfect film.",9
2024-05-27,"So so good. Love Gosling here, Bryan Cranston honestly fucking everyone dleievrs a great performance. The driving scenes are great, the action fucking kills, I love the story particularly that Bryan Cranston scene (y'all know what I'm talking about). ",9
2024-05-27,Not a lot of driving in a movie called drive!,5
2024-05-27,"The colors, vibe, and soundtrack are still gravy.  Violence is jarring even for my fucked up tastes.",9
2022-08-11,"Solid but forgettable, I’m not even sure if I finished it. I think I would’ve liked it better if my expectations weren’t outrageously high from the Drive memes.",6
2024-05-27,wait this is just the gutsier and better shot Fall Guy,7
2024-05-27,low key disappointed. hard to keep up,5
2024-05-26,This is me (I can't drive),6
2024-05-27,"Standard Gabriel is an all-time name tho, so bonus points",6
2024-05-27,Ryan Gosling Has like 20 lines in this but he carries the whole film single-handedly.Everything was just great. Maybe I'll like it more in a rewatch.,9
2024-05-26,Stick to the 5 minute rule,7
2024-05-25,This is still a movie that makes me excited about movies.,9

2024-05-27,I watched this while doing my driving courses cause that’s literally about to be me,10
2024-05-27,"my favorite part was when ryan gosling said ""It's drivin' time"" then drove all over the screen",5

2024-05-26,"I am not literally Ryan Gosling in this movie at all. This wasn’t like really my thing, if i want to watch a film bro “Ryan Gosling is literally me” movie id choose Blade Runner 2049 every time. My heart is saying a 3 but im giving it a 3.5 because i can appreciate some things about this movie (mostly the soundtrack and Ryan)",7
2022-07-03,literally me (im ryan gosling),10
2024-05-26,"This movie has such a simple premise, which makes it easy to watch. the writing was great and especially the direction and acting. Refn and Gosling are able to convey so much emotional depth. It deserves all of the love that it gets, and don't believe the people that say that it's boring just because there’s so little dialogue. Really good watch!",8
2024-05-27,The last NRW film that doesn’t bend over backwards to be abstract. Never gets old. Great film.,10
2024-05-27,Loved this film. such a cool aestetic but doesn't do too much. you really don't know what will happen. and the song nightfall has such a cool intro,9
2024-05-26,"Ryan Gosling, in the nicest and kindest way possible, looks like a wet kitten",8
2024-05-26,Ryan Gosling is the love of my life in this movie. Omg I would really like a jacket like he's 🦂🦂🦂,10
2024-05-27,"Where can I get that jacket,And the real question, where is he driving too next? Drive 2?",8
2024-05-27,"Good action, good gore (unexpected but welcomed) but takes too long to get anything plot wise",7

2024-05-27,Literally me…,10
2024-05-26,"I dunno it just didn’t speak to me. Don’t get me wrong, the practical effects were awesome, some shots were artsy, and there were some great action, but it rung hollow after I finished the movie. Maybe I have to rewatch this again, but for me it was alright.",5
2024-05-26,im in me mums car,10
2024-05-27,This is legit the worst film ive ever seen,1
2024-05-27,this is so driving core,6
2024-05-26,"Again, love Ryan Gosling, and this is amazing! I love the ending and the tension! Amazing metaphor as well :)",9
2024-05-26,the soundtrack and how they play with lighting is absolutely crazy (i am literally him) i was also on shazam for half the film,9
2024-05-26,oh my god I love ryan gosling so much,10

2024-05-26,"This movie is very much actually overrated, i mean cool stuff happens and all, but i geniunely expected more, like fights are nice and all and there is actually just one scene of some cool driving and thats it. I expected more.",7
2024-05-26,"At this rate of mafia killings, how are they still not extinct 🤔",6

2024-05-25,"If I could cross into an alternate timeline, I can see a lot of things changing in my life. Maybe I live in another part of the world, or perhaps I might not have as big an interest in film. But no matter how many realities there could be, one thing I never see changing, is Drive being one of my favourite films.",10
2024-05-25,"This is a purely emotional movie for me. Refn, after his Copenhagen films, developed a high contrast, vibrant style where sound design carries all the weight. I see people complaining about the ""Under Your Spell"" scene, because it's bad that an audio-visual medium uses music and actor's faces to convey the thoughts in a character's head rather than them ""cleverly"" dictating to the audience. It's funny this at one time was considered pretentious because it's actually a very earnest and straightforward narrative.",10
2024-05-25,It’s alright. The dialogue scenes felt a bit too artsy for my taste and consisted of a lot more staring than I felt was necessary to set the mood. The violence also felt very gratuitous.,6
2024-05-26,"I’ve heard a lot of good things about this film but after watching it I’m not sure I’ve watched the correct film. I liked the cinematography and the lighting and the music etc but the actual film it self seemed lacking. It must have been the easiest film Ryan gosling has done due to the, maybe 5 lines he says through the whole film. It’s not a film I’m gonna watch again. However if you haven’t watched it please do and tell me if I’m missing something I should have seen.",6
2024-05-26,Love Ryan Gosling but the movie lacked a bit. Too many awkward pauses & i wasnt very invested 😞 womp,4

2024-05-26,"Fantastic film, highly recommended and I can see why. Ryan Gosling is excellent, and his character development is top notch. Wish we got to see him drive a bit more in the different getaways etc.",9
2024-05-26,this movie gets so many things right,9
2024-05-26,God damn I love this movie. One of those movies that kind of follows that Denis Villenueve principal of “cinema is more about action and less about dialogue” because Gosling barely speaks. The little nuanced nonverbal communication throughout between him and Carey is great. Also that elevator scene gets better and better. Just an awesome vibes movie.,8
2024-05-26,Pointless,4
2024-05-25,it’s ok but i expected more action,5
2024-05-26,"Watched on Korean Netflix, which doesn’t have English subs for this movie. Was worried I wouldn’t understand the dialogue but turns out most of the movie is characters staring at each other so I was worried for nothing!",5

2024-05-25,"This film is so meditative. Every shot is measured and lit with such purpose and excellence. NWR makes expressionist action films where the characters exist in such a neo-reality that their actions are just pure emotion expressed. The soundtrack is the unbridled emotion of the characters, specifically driver, and each inclusion of a song is the expression of his thoughts and feelings he can’t put into words.",10

2024-05-26,"I'm just so disappointed. There's nothing but Ryan Gosling and Bryan Cranston. It ended up just being a challenge to watch it all. The ending, wtf?

Go and see this film!",10
,"As of October 27, my favourite film of 2011. I've been following Refn since the Pusher Trilogy, and this movie further proves him as the twisted lovechild of Kubrick and early Scorsese, all grown-up and seemingly immune to artistic compromise.",10
2011-10-28,"Definitely holds up on a second viewing. Extremely tense with great style and fantastic performances. I loved the use of reflective surfaces, that I didn't really pick up on the first time I saw it.

Gosling oozes cool, star power whilst a gripping support cast throw their experienced chops into the mix to great effect. Ron Pearlman & Albert Brooks as Jewish criminal odd couple are particularly stand-out. If the emotional tone of the film loses its way at times this can be forgiven by the meditative beauty and smart economy of dialogue. One that requires a few more viewings...",8

Just like there are some fights in Fight Club, there is some driving in Drive - is there ever - but it's not what the film is about, not really. It's just an element, something that happens while the story is playing out.",9

2011-11-08,When I first saw the trailer for Drive I had high hopes and even with all the build up it still exceeded my expectations. Drive is some one those movies that comes close to perfection. Everything about it is amazing. There's great attention to detail and there needs to be because no shot is cut prematurely. You're given the time to take everything in and really feel the intensity.,10

2011-11-11,"I loved the pacing of this film; where most modern action flicks are non-stop go-go-go, Drive lets you savour the moment. The slow-mo pans and drawn-out pauses really let you chew things over and this really drew me in like no other film I've seen for quite some time.",10
2011-11-12,"I was expecting a lot from this movie but it didn't deliver. Through out the movie, the pace was so slow that I started reading news while waiting for something to happen. All the dialog and action could be summed up in a 5 minute clip.",4
2011-11-13,"I wish more filmmakers understood that you don't need a lot of dialogue to tell a story well. A simple premise made into something a lot better than usual, at least in part, by the way the characters develop onscreen.",8
2011-11-11,"A beautifully crafted film, with consideration in every shot and a kick-ass soundtrack. Winding Refn certainly earned his Best Director award at Cannes this year, helped greatly by the outstanding performances of Gosling and Mulligan. I'll definitely need to see this again, and while I'm not much a fan of ultra-violence I couldn't imagine it working any other way in this film.",10
,Incredible,10
,"It's hard to think of a way this film could have been any better. Quiet, moving, with intense moments and razor-sharp focus on its simple story. This is great filmmaking.",10
2011-11-12,"‎'Drive': Holy shit is this a smart film or what? Perfectly matched soundtrack, absolutely stunning directing (to the point of showing off!) and another great acting performance by Ryan Gosling. The first act is a little slow, especially after a beautifully constructed opening sequence, but it does do a good job of building the tension for the rest of the film. Good shit.",10
,"I'm still chewing on this. There are parts I really enjoyed, and parts I absolutely despised. I imagine that's by design, but it was still hard for me to get behind it. I'll say this though: Beautifully shot, loved the sound and music, and Ryan Gosling did a great job. That first chase scene was a sight to behold.",6
2011-11-11,"I only saw 3.5 stars worth of this movie, as the R18 violence was beyond my personal violence threshold. But Gosling was 3.5/3.5 stars worth of hotness to re-emerge from behind boyfriend's shoulder for.",7
,"What an awesome movie, a little bit gory for my liking but showcases some awesome driving. By the way I really want some driving gloves now",10
,"Incredible soundtrack. Great mood. Everything else just fell flat to me. It's sad really, I badly wanted to like this movie.",5
2011-11-09,It was good.,7
2011-11-08,Great but a little to violent for my liking. And Gosling said very little,7
,"It is funny how the trailer makes the movie looks like a fast pace action one when in reality it is so quiet, slow, contemplative with great refinement. The play of all the actors are absolutely amazing. I really did enjoy the movie. And the soundtrack is so mind freezing. Cliff Martinez has created a masterpiece. I could listen to ""Where's the Deluxe Version"" endlessly.",8
,Loved the lo-fi tone of this movie and the synth-pop soundtrack. Totally not what I was expecting. This is what The Transporter would have been like if it were made in the early 80s.,8
,"Atmospheric and detached, punctuated by moments of shocking violence. Gosling is excellent, Brooks really embraced what could have been a standard villain role, and the soundtrack stuck in my head for weeks. The scene in the motel is what directing is about.",8
,It's been awhile since I last saw a movie that good. Drive is beautifully stylized and the story catch your breath!,10
2011-11-18,"Fabulous film. Hid my eyes through the extreme violence, but that took nothing away from the mesmerising performance of Ryan Gosling. The whole pace of the film was built around silence and stillness...awesome.",9
,"Still not sure... I want to like it but the blood lust was just a little too much for me. Not boring... a bit of a boys flick, but some chicks will survive watching this too.",7
,"My Movie of the year SO FAR !! Stunning, Genius, Slow Moving, Amazing ... where do i stop. Soundtrack is excellent & Mr Gosling just hits it out of the Ballpark ! Seriously : AMAZING (but in a subtle way) !!!!!",10
,I've watched this film three times in total hoping that it would grow on me and i'd experience the hype that i've been reading everywhere. ,7
,"A great movie - beautifully shot, great soundtrack, excellent performances from the whole cast. Although there are moments of violence - it is not a violent film. Really great adaptation.",10

,"Read a review somewhere anointing Refn/Gosling as the newDe Niro/Scorsese tandem of the modern era, after watching Drive, the partnership is off to a transcendent start.",10
,Straight in to my top five movies of all time....,10
,"Quite simply, this is a great LA movie. The more knowledge of this style of cinema you bring to it, the more you get out of it. Not just highly stylized and sophisticated eye candy - this is well written yet calculated for mainstream appeal. It’s best of genre stuff, and the first must-see film of the year for me.",9
,Ryan Gosling plays an autistic savant who's super powers include driving and murder.,6
2011-11-24,Thank god for Ryan Gosling being in this otherwise I'd have probably had my hands covering my eyes for the whole film thanks to the gore.,7
2011-11-29,"Gosling is epic in this movie. Master of silence, pace and ruining your face.",9
2011-11-29,This was my favorite film of the year. Perfect blend of Terminator 2 and Collateral; and the music was a spell:,9
,Too good. Wonderful in every way.,10
,Drive rocks the eighties better than the eighties did; It's Michael Mann on steroids. By the far the best film this year.,10
2011-12-06,Loved it! A roller coaster of a movie where the pace goes up and down. Excellent opening scene followed by quietness and excitement along the way. Oh ... and the font used for the title really sucks!,9
,"It was quite ok action movie, might watch it again in future.",7
,"After hearing nothing but positive reviews for Drive, I went into the cinema with high expectations. I wasn’t just disappointed, I was crushed.",4
,One of the best films of 2011.,10
2011-12-11,"Excellent movie. A little slow, but superb acting by Ryan Gosling. Really enjoyed it.",9
2011-12-11,Really enjoyed the style...,6
2011-12-08,"Drive moves at a very slow pace, which is why the violence, which is graphic and sudden, is so jarring. An atmospheric film more than anything, this is one of my favourites for the year.",8
2011-11-23,A gem of a movie.moves at a very languid pace and then suddenly jolts you with the graphic nature of its action .Ryan Gosling is perfect for the Role.Noir .,8
2011-12-12,"Great filmmaking, great music! In the beginning it looks a bit dull, but it's getting better and better.",7
,"I went in expecting too much (especially given how Warrior lived up to the hype). I can't say I was disappointed—it's a good movie—but it didn't unzip and blow me away. Good soundtrack, but nothing like what Daft Punk did with TRON:Legacy.",8
,Very surprising. Very brutal. I liked Albert Brooks in this a lot.,8
,awesome soundtrack aswell.,9
,Gosling and the soundtrack is amazing. The story isn't bad either but lacks that special something to get five stars.,9
2011-11-11,"The tech writer John Gruber is fond of a Kubrick quote about the truth of a thing being in the feel of it rather than the think of it, a phrase that for me perfectly explains the appeal of Nicolas Winding Refn’s noirish adaptation of the James Sallis novel. Right from the first hotel-room scene, through a near wordless fifteen-minute opening stanza, the foreboding atmosphere of an after-hours, back-streets Los Angeles takes hold. An ambient, minimal score by Cliff Martinez…",10
2011-12-03,"Best movie of 2011! Great performances, great music, beautiful cinematography! An instant classic.",10
,I was expecting an action thriller but I discovered a Love story. :),10
,"Hands-down my favorite movie of 2011, and one of my favorite films of all time. There was a power to this film that's almost impossible to describe. It certainly was nothing like the trailers, and that's a *very* good thing. An action film for the arthouse crowd.",10
,"meh. Great supporting cast and some nice cinematography, but Gosling is a flat line dead fish throughout. I just don't see what everyone loves about that guy, other than the looks thing, I mean.",6
,"Pretty Spectacular. Soundtrack is brilliant and cinematography beautiful. Noirish and pulp references provide the film with texture, and refreshingly the director leaves the actors the emote in long takes. Not for everyone but deeply impressive piece if film",8
,"Interesting, but not a conventional film... I'm still not sure how I feel about Nicholas Winding Refn.",5
2011-12-09,"Drive is the story of a simple man who finds love with a semi-mute simple single mum. Their long silences don't feel awkward, as neither seems aware of what's happening. When it starts to feel like nothing is going to happen they go for a drive and nothing happens. Simple pleasures like finding a pond strewn with rubbish are enjoyed as if words could not and will not describe.",8
,"This is one of the movies on my must-watch list, but when I finally watched it I was greatly disappointed and puzzled. Disappointed, because I did not enjoy the movie very much; puzzled, because of all the praises I've read about this movie.",5
,Favorite of 2011. I loved everything about it. Meticulously well-crafted. Everything from the music in the opening sequence down to the ultra-violence was fitting and well-done.,10
,Feel-good movie of the year.,9
2011-12-18,"While I appreciated the cinematography and soundtrack, I just never connected with this story. Never felt attached to any of the characters, and therefore didn't really care what was happening on the screen. Just not for me, I guess.",6
2011-12-20,Stylish and tense with equal helpings of loveliness and ultra-violance. What's not to like?,9
2011-12-20,I really don't see the hype about this movie at all. Well-balanced and pretty cinematography is about all it's got. It has an overall emptiness that the looks and style don't make up for.,6
2011-12-18,"This is one of the best films I've seen in recent years. It doesn't have much dialogue, but it's ok, it doesn't need it. Ryan Gosling is like a modern Clint Eastwood, where only a few words are needed. And did I mention the music? Well, don't even get me started on the soundtrack of the decade...",9
2011-12-22,Well brought movie. The subdued atmosphere really enhances the intense moments. Great DOP job!,8

2011-12-09,Interesting cinematography in combo with great soundtrack. Like Gosling's versatility.,8

,Superb Soundtrack and excellent acting by Gosling,8
2011-12-24,"It's so nice when you have expectations of a movie and then you see the movie and it doesn't disappoint. Drive is a thousand kinds of crazy cool - the sharp, bright colours, the awesome driving scenes, that epic throwback soundtrack. In my experience, Ryan Gosling does cool much better than he does romantic, and he broods like a pro all the way through this, making it all the more powerful when he shoots someone a half-smile or carries a…",9
,"One of the best films I've seen in the cinema this year, no doubt.",10
2011-12-26,"Probably the best movie I have seen this year. Very very very stylish city scene, great pace, not the most complicated story you have seen, but not all movie should be complicated right?",10
2011-12-25,"It's a really good movie. Amazing soundtrack. I can't think of anything that should have been done differently. But ... it's not like it's any better than a typical episode of Breaking Bad. That's high praise, but this is a feature film, not an episode of basic-cable TV. So it left me wanting more. What's there is great, and the minimalism and tight focus is part of what makes it so great -- but it just feels a bit too lean to me.",8
2011-12-27,"After all the good reviews I really expected more than that. Feels slow, overhyped and decent at most. Not making my favorites list any time soon.",7
,True power of silence.,10
,"It was hard to escape the hype surrounding this release, starring crowd-elected ladies man, Ryan Gosling. That didn't stop it from being a very good and enjoyable film. For the first third of the film the dialogue is sparse, but it slowly builds, much like the action.",8
,"This movie came out of left field. After seeing a trailer for a film that came across as ""Fast and the Furious"", my friends and I were shocked to see that the film had received many amazing ratings for respectable film critics (Ha! Oxymoron!) so we went to go see it. I was completely blown away. This was the complete opposite of what it was marketed as. A character type who doesn't fit in the modern day world. It intertwines…",10
,"Awesome story, awesome direction and awesome soundtrack. What more can I say?",8
,"By keeping his past in dark, effect of violence is multiplied - neat trick.Pace of the movie is alienates. Shots are, what's the word, sexy.",6
2011-12-29,"Not quite sure what I think of this one. It's a really cool movie with some great acting, directing and violence, but at times it just wasn't riveting enough. Second viewing required.",7
,"Born of Shane and Clint Eastwood and Heat and Ghost Dog, a beautiful modern-day fairy-tale told with a lullaby feel and hints of extreme violence. Gosling is resplendent as the superhuman hero, raging in suppressed savagery against the comic book villains to save the damsel in distress. Stunning.",9
,Not for people with short attention span.Not for people who can't stand gory violence.Not for people who don't like 80's music.I loved it.,9
2011-12-26,Best movie of 2011.,10
,"There's ""tense"" and then there's Drive. A great, great film.",10
2012-01-02,I liked it a lot!,8
2012-01-02,"This was a solid, well executed film, not entirely as vapid as the premise implies. The script is pretty predictable, the characters don't require a whole lot of acting chops, but the acting is good enough that it carries a pretty bland concept. Good directing, good cinematography. Overall a ""good"" film, nothing particularly spectacular about it, but Ryan Gosling is quickly becoming one of my favorite young actors.",7
,"Not a huge fan of Baby Goose but this film was pretty badass! Would have given it a higher rating, but dragged a little too long in a few scenes.",8
,Superb film from a great director!,10
,"Strange film. Really slow first half, better in the second half.",6
,"weird, disturbing but a very worth-your-while experience.",7
2012-01-04,"It's testament to the film that I can watch it on a shitty airplane screen and still love it. Stylish but not vapid. Gosling is pretty remarkable, and manages to do so much while saying so little. The elevator scene knocked me out.",8
,"Loved it... I was interested upon hearing it was the same director as ""BRONSON""... Great acting and spot-on direction",10
2012-01-08,"Great action, amazing production and a really unpredictable story make this a great watch!",10
2012-01-08,Holy crap.,10
2012-01-07,"I'm not a big fan of Ryan Gosling, but really enjoyed his performance in this film – perhaps because he didn't have much dialogue to his character. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen, and along with the masterful soundtrack and sound design, are worth it for seeing this film. There are some clear homages to Taxi Driver, but I think this one stands on its own in keeping a certain calm/cool factor to each scene, no matter how tense. Above all, its a beautiful study of the interplay between shadow and light - which should be at the core of any film.",8
,Hands down my favourite film of 2011.,10
2012-01-09,"I like getting surprised while watching films. And i was surprised by how good Drive was. I was expecting something along the lines of 'Fast and Furious', but this film has just about enough depth and style to make it enjoyable. It seems like 2011 was the year of Ryan Gosling.",8
2012-01-07,"So after hearing from a bunch of friends that this movie was worth the watch, I decided to check it out this weekend. ",7
2012-01-02,"I don’t get it, I really don’t. Why does everyone love this movie so much? I like Ryan Gosling and was very glad to discover Carey Mulligan but I was still bored for much of the movie. It was hard to understand the protagonist’s motivation behind doing the things he did. It felt like I was out of the loop throughout the flick. I would not recommend it.",4
,"Essentially an extremely violent John Hughes movie, Nicolas Winding Refn directs with stylistic precision. A hard-boiled drama with impeccable performances and a spot-on soundtrack.",9
,"This is the best film I have seen since No Country for Old Men. The overwhelming sense of an inescapable fate; and the idea that it doesn't matter how good your intentions are, things are just going to happen, are what made this film perfect for me.",10
,"Seriously disappointed. I've seen hundreds of movies, but damned if I can find the art that so many others have seen. I did enjoy Brooks though.:-)",5
,"My favorite movie of 2011. Beautiful, quiet, over-the-top, gruesome, tasteful, tacky, hilarious, well-acted, poorly-acted, great music, terrible music, etc.",9
2011-09-25,"Beautiful cinematography, fantastic atmosphere and pacing let down by a horrible script with dialogue that seemed written by a 13 year old, poorly written one dimensional characters and mediocre acting.",6
,"Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn won the Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival for his moody stunt driver drama, and it's easy to see why. Inspired by Bullitt and lots of ultra-pulpy noir, Drive is evocative of some great American films from the 70s. It has a style and attitude that isn't seen often these days, with an audacious leading man who is just as powerful being a surrogate father as he is when he's beating the brains…",10

,"I really like Nicolas Winding Refn's movies and I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but was ultimately disappointed with it for whatever reason. Still can't quite put my finger on it.",6
,my favourite film ever having surpassed inception and Wall-e,10
,This movie beat The Social Network as my favorite film. There isn't a lot of movies where you can feel the raw emotion from the main protagonist with a few words being said.,10

2012-01-12,"Simple story, heist goes wrong, guy goes into revenge mode to protect another man's family, great scenes, steady pace, and a couple of action scenes with lots of gore, go see it now!",8
,Favorite film of 2011. Miami Vice-esque titles/music set a strange tone right off the bat (especially in a theater). Gestures and glances played as much of a part as the dialogue. EPIC elevator scene. Drive is unique. It's modern-day noir. Very excited to see what's next for Nicolas Winding Refn (pretentious name and all)...,10
2012-01-06,"It's slow. It's weird and it's getting violent at the end. And that part I don't like, cause I have a feeling I saw that before. The greatly played main character disappear between those violent scenes.",6

2011-12-19,It was certainly worth the hype. It seemed a spiritual successor to 80s flair.,10

,"I mean it was okay, I guess. I think I waited too long to see it and heard too much hype about it. I'm not really into this thing that filmakers do with the long stretches of no dialog. It's like a cheap way to seem deep (Terrence Malick, I'm looking at you). Sometimes it works and fits well with the tone of the movie (Brokeback Mountain) and sometimes it makes the movie drag, which is what I felt the…",6
,"Nicolas Winding Refn’s DRIVE is simply perfect. Not since Michael Mann’s 1981 crime drama THIEF, has a film of this type had such an impact, and dare I say DRIVE is even better? Yes, I do. Every woman’s newest sweetheart, Ryan Gosling (CRAZY STUPID LOVE) is Driver, a nameless Hollywood stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver. He lives simply, adhering to a strict set of rules, which keeps him at the top of his game, out of prison… and…",10
2012-01-01,Nice movie that starts off a bit slow but gets better and better. Loved the soundtrack!,9
,"There are plenty of movies that are set in Los Angeles but very few of them know how to truly utilize the city. Director Nicolas Winding Refn and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel were able to capture the metropolitan cityscape in a fashion that highlights the beauty of the city as well as exposes its seedy underbelly. Take the opening sequence for example; the audience is introduced to the unnamed main character, Driver, as he drives for two small time crooks…",10
,"Artful, but not particularly to my taste. Pace felt far too slow for my liking.",6
2012-01-13,"On paper, Drive sounds like a generic flick, with a plot reminiscent of both Walter Hill’s The Driver and more recently, three Transporter sillinesses (it’s a word). And at one point it was destined to be a ""standard action movie"" with Hugh Jackman in the lead. Thankfully, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn jumped on board and created a modern masterpiece of cool austerity. In a world full of bloated, CGI-botoxed action movies, Drive shows how the genre can still surprise…",10
,My film of 2011. The best soundtrack of the year.,10
2011-12-27,"One of the absolutely best films I've seen in a long while. It's a bit slow, and it's ment to be – it's done the right way. Also the soundtrack is awesome.",9
2012-01-12,"Starts with pink 1980's font title sequence that would be at home in an early Madonna movie. Unlike Clooney's interest in making new films in a ""classic"" style (e.g. The American or Michael Clayton), this film seems to be the real deal. It's not a ""take"" on the era, it's a throwback. Quite weird.",8
2012-01-17,Reminded me a bit of a David Lynch flick.,7
,A stand-out in 2011. Music is repetitive but great. Gosling is the pinnacle of cool. Action scenes were simple but still had you at the edge of your seat. Buy it.,9
2011-09-20,"If you didn't like this film, you're just being contrary for the sake of being. Beautiful shots, amazing soundtrack and performances by Ryan Gosling & Albert Brooks that were unforgettable. A big recommend for any fan of action based noir.",10

,I seem to be in a minority of people who were completely underwhelmed and disappointed with this film. ,3
2012-01-18,"Its plot is far from groundbreaking, but it doesn't matter. Drive is exceptionally stylish and beautiful one second and absolutely terrifying the next. It has a unique atmosphere that manages to shrink an entire theatre to the size of a passengers seat (thank you Cliff Martinez).",8
,For me a top 5 film of 2011,8
,"Disappointed. Very stylish, but shallow movie. I wanted to like it so badly, but in the end I can’t recommend it.",4
2012-01-19,"A very good thriller. I really liked the character Gosling is playing. He looks innocent in the beginning, a person with good heart, but as soon the story continues the character develops into a cold blooded one.It is a unique picture. The style is so different compared to other thrillers. The ending is somewhat mysterious and open ended. So it might lead to a sequel, which I hope would never be announced. If there won't be a sequel then people will still talk about for years to come. Everybody having a different interpretation of the ending of the movie.",8
,Really nice movie!,10
2012-01-21,"Not at all as good as expected based on the hype, slow moving and quite boring at times, but some scenes makes up for it and pushes it to 3/5",6
2012-01-22,"Wow, this was a very good movie, acting instead of vocalizing the feelings the viewer should see. No stupid lets shock the viewers with maxed-out music & sound effects, but just moments of near silence and a beautiful set of sound tracks to match the atmosphere. Did find the violence a bit on the rough/bloody side.",8
2012-01-23,someone likes scorcese.,7
2011-10-16,"From the director that gave us the fantasic Pusher trilogy Nicolas Winding Refn, Drive is a different, non main-stream film that I absolutely love. Ryan Gosling plays the sociopath absolutely perfectly. I highly recommend watching this film!",10
,Kim Kardashian's last marriage was more believable than the actions of the driver.,5
,Quite possibly the coolest film of the 21st Century.,8
2011-10-16,Could have been so much before. A killer soundtrack and sleek look aren't enough to compensate for the lack of character development and simply cold feeling I was left with when I exited the theater.,5
,"Can I give this movie 10 stars?? Everything about this movie makes me want to marry it. The control, the exhilaration, the silence, the determination left such an impression on me. It deserves a Best Picture nomination in my opinion, but the Academy won't ever acknowledge a movie like this. Ryan Gosling is the man!",10
2011-12-22,"Saw this the day it opened, have seen it 4 more times theatrically. I additionally have a screener that I watch on a regular basis until I can buy the official DVD. I love Winding-Refn and I love this film.",10
2012-01-08,"beautiful cinematography & score, flawless execution",10
2012-01-11,It's all about the atmoshpere and the brooding presence of Gosling. I promise: You won't get the soundtrack out of your head.,10
,The arthouse enthusiast's answer to The Fast & The Furious. This film blends pure old school 80s style with some gripping action sequences and moments of shocking violence. Ryan Gosling and Albert Brooks are particular standouts amongst a very worthy cast.,9
,Brilliant! And I want his jacket minus the blood.,10
2012-01-14,"It's one of the best looking and sounding films I've scene for years. Los Angeles looked fantastic and the soundtrack complimented the cinematography beautifully. The only flaw was that at times I found myself waiting for something to happen, for it to jump up a notch, and I was slightly disappointed when it didn't. However I am probably being overly critical. Highly recommended",9
,Pure pulp fiction - Drive proves that style over substance isn't always a bad thing.,8

2011-11-14,"An awesome, nearly perfect thriller.",10
2011-09-16,"Amazing movie that was shot beautifully, cast well, and has a soundtrack that fits perfectly. To make it even more impressive, it was only an independent film with a small budget. All of the moronic Fast-and-Furious-Transformer-Michael-Bay-loving idiots are just mad because there weren't any unrealistic car chases or heists, no Vin Diesel, and no billion dollar budget. Favorite movie of 2011.",10
,"Nicolas Winding Refn makes a movie with the minimalist cool of Walter Hill, the existentialism of Jean Pierre Melville and the neo-noir atmosphere of early Michael Mann. A modern masterpiece.",10
2012-01-25,Believe the hype. This is a brutal and brilliant neon-noir and Gosling is the man.,10
,"What else is there to say about Drive at this point? This movie might as well have been a check-list of things I love: gritty 70s thriller feel (""Thief"" anyone?) with 80s throwback music? Check. Stoic yet emotional performance from the lead? Check. Carey Mulligan? Albert Brooks? Check and check. Worth the hype.",8
2011-09-16,"Possibly the artsiest action film i've ever seen, but also one of the best.",8
,"I will never underestimate Ryan Gosling as an actor ever again. He delivers a fantastic performance as the mostly silent Driver who is out for revenge after a heist gone wrong. It balances sweet scenes of the Driver driving through the sunset and the violence acts he has to incur to protect the ones he cares about. I’m not gonna say much more about it, but you can read my review and then go see for yourself.",10
,My favorite film of 2011. Just damn cool.,8
2011-09-11,"That movie put some hair on my chest. Its not often that we have a movie that blends ultra violence with compelling story. ""Drive"" throws you against your seat and says ""Shutup, I'm driving."" Now before you continue to read on. I want to mention that I saw this movie without seeing the trailer or anything. The only thing I knew about this movie going in is the title and that it starred Ryan Gosling. I encourage anybody who sees…",10
2012-01-02,Amazing performances from all involved. Ryan Gosling plays the driver in a subtle performance with menacing undertones of violence. Brilliant use of music in the film. Nicolas Winding Refn has put his finger on the synth-driven pulse of neo-noir 80s thrillers like Thief & To Live & Die In L.A..,9
,"Just loved this, beautiful violent movie.",9
,Just saw this a few weeks ago and I was blown away by the soundtrack!,7
,"You may get the wrong impression about Drive of you watch the trailer first. Is it a action movie like 'Transporter' were the special effects are more important the storyline? With Drive you couldn't be more far from the true. This is a character movie. Ryan Gosling in a good drama role, most of the time you don't know what his character is thinking and what would be his next move. Carey Mulligan plays a role we have seen her…",8
2011-12-28,Wow. Gosling is immense. The timing of the film is perfect. Out of nowhere this suave flick starts pumping and it never stops. Not the film of 2011 but certainly the surprise,9
,"One of my absolute favorite films of 2011, completely overlooked by the Oscar committee. And that's too bad.",10
2012-01-18,Perfect. One of the most intense opening sequences in recent memory. I felt like I was on a cinematic high watching this. Most of the film felt very surreal.,10
,"Ryan Gosling plays every overhyped Ryan Gosling character ever, though the soundtrack and aesthetics were well done, and contains a surprisingly decent Tarantinoesque flourish.",6
2011-08-06,"A car, action, adrenaline and Ryan gosling. Drive is a thrill ride that will bound you every single second of it and one of the best scene directed movie if seen in recent time.",10

,This movie needs no explaining. One of the best movies I saw in 2011. Go watch!!,8
,"Take »The Transporter«, remove the muscle character, add one with actual acting skills and profile.But also remove the action part of the story. And that's really a pity: Drive has so much potential, but I don't really like the calm atmosphere which is above all. It could have been a really really good action movie with a great actor. Like this it's just a ride on the indie rocket without engine ignition. (But that's what most people like about the film, so it seems to be just my problem.)",7
2012-01-26,"As skilled and suave as the driver we watch in awe for two hours, is the direction of Nicolas Winding Refn who tells a story about violence, isolation and the chaos that follows when you break the rules. You get a flavor from Michael Mann's movies, from Scorsese's Taxi Driver, but make no mistake, this movie stands alone in its own as one of the best film making examples of 2011. Awesome.",9
,"Though Drive is probably one of the slickest 'heist' films out there right now, and definitely one of the few existentialist crime films, it unfortunately left me a little cold. The problem isn't in the writing, acting or directing, its just that the film never quite lives up to the promise of that great opening scene. Still, a fantastic film, and a lot of fun to watch.",7

2011-10-03,"At times subdued and other times explosively violent, Refn's film inexplicably captures the ethereal, pop-infused haze of the early 1980s while subtly examining obsession and isolation.",10
2011-12-15,"This is a pretty special picture: calm und suspenseful, cool and shy, sweet and violent. By consequently avoiding to draw cliché stereotypes, Nicolas Winding Refn manages to create a modern classic.",7
2012-01-29,"Powerfull and beautifully directed. weakness? the screenplay. It´s not about the lack of words. Sergio Leone and Takeshi Kitano builded pontent and deepest antiheroes from pratically mute characters. In Drive the plot is not believable-important-or different enough to care. An Indycar race turned into a ""just nice"" ride@cinetweetica",4
2012-01-30,"Great film - it's rather classic Refn, but on a whole new international level which suits him well. It reminds me of the Pusher trilogi with it's raw realistic violence. Going to re-watch this very soon again.",8
2012-01-27,"2011 was a great year of film for me. A few movies came out that will most likely become all time favorites of mine. So when I say that Drive was the best film of 2011, I really mean it. Although you might also catch me saying that Attack The Block was my favorite film of 2011. And I really mean that too. Sure, it is probably a cop out to have both a “best” and a “favorite” of a…",10

,"Slick style and good acting/cast, but it didn't grab me as some other people. Need to re-watch this one.",7
,Ryan Gosling's 'Driver' is this generation's 'The Man With No Name'. Refn's auteur hand is visible throughout. The chase scenes are mature and tense; the violence may put some people off. The elevator scene was one of the best scenes I've seen in recent times. And the synth score is unlike any soundtrack heard before.,9

2012-02-01,"More a love story than straight-up action film, Nicolas Winding Refn's DRIVE deconstructs the ""cool hero"" archetype, delivering an absolutely beautiful and complex film that reveals an extra layer of depth on repeat viewings. Ryan Gosling comes the closest any actor ever has to channeling the late Steve McQueen, but makes the nameless Driver his own character.",10

It reminds me of some of the other great movies in the 80s like Michael Mann's Thief and Walter Hill's 1979 Driver film which are masterpieces.,10

2012-02-02,Great opening sequence - the best car chase with the least car chasing. Great sound track and sound design. Looks great and truly involving story. And all wrapped up in 1hr 40min. Some people say it feels European - for some reason to me it feels Australian (see Animal Kingdom for example).,10
,"Great music and art direction. Awesome and fresh if you haven't seen ""The Driver"" (1978).",7
,"Brilliant storytelling, fantastic performances, and a minimal script that has you fall in love with the characters. One of my favorite films of 2011.",10

2012-02-02,"Like many others, Drive was my top film of 2011 and slipped straight into my top 10 favourite films. Gosling's incredible, it's beautifully crafted and features one of last years best soundtracks. I cannot praise it highly enough.",10
,"Another stoic character study from Nicolas Winding Refn. Only this time instead of the mute ancient Scottish warrior of Valhalla Rising, we have only a slightly more talkative getaway driver in contemporary Los Angeles. It's a traditional Noir-ish double-cross crime movie oozing with an 80s visual aesthetic and a synth-pop soundtrack. With it's barebones narrative and lovingly preened costumes and set design, it has attracted complaints of style of content. It's all constructed with the typical flair the poster boy…",6

,"Of the many films I wanted to see but couldn’t during my months in Guatemala, none was discussed and hyped as much as Nicolas Winding Refn’s (or should that be Ryan Gosling’s?) Drive. Having finally seen it, I can understand why. It is an especially bizarre film for a number of reasons, quite unlike anything that’s been released in a long while, and yet stars the undisputed “it” boy of the moment in a car-based “action” movie during the shockingly…",8
2012-01-31,electric. This was a seriously beautiful film. The soundtrack rocked and the violence was artful and intense. Albert Brooks also knocked one out of the park. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan were electrifying. A must see.,7
,"Winding-Refn's slow burn, pop crime study excites and unnerves all at once. As a meditation on genre (heist, thriller, action, car chase, horror) it excels without postmodern winks and nudges, all while offering a stripped down narrative that's as angsty and engrossing as its hero. Check out Vallhalla Rising for a more spiritual and experimental take on similar themes but, y'know, with Vikings.",10
2012-02-03,"An instant addition to my favourite films of all time. Pretty much the best film I've seen for years, I only wish I'd watched it at the cinema.",10
,"This Ryan Gosling action flick follows a getaway driver who's life changes when he meets a neighbour turned love interest who's husband at the start of the film is searing time in jail. After some background at the start of the film showing Gosling life as a driver and stunt man, the film becomes more action packed featuring real to life violence and pursuits. Whilst these action sequences are reasonably far fetched they do not feel as if they are…",10
,"There aren't enough superlatives in the dictionary to adequately explain my thoughts on this dazzling film. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's definetly my favorite film of 2011. It's a simple enough premise, a Hollywood stunt-driver by day and getaway driver for hire by night gets caught up in a tangled web of deception and villainy. The beauty here lies in the execution. Nicolas Windig Refn finally hits his stride, and he does so on all cylinders.…",9

I was seduced after the first 10 minutes thanks to an amazing intro. Then I thought the momentum would go down and become more like a classical movie, but not at all : the script is intelligent and surprising. The subtile tone of this movie is great, the directing with a 70s 80s retro…",10
2012-02-03,"Technically, the movie is perfect. As a whole, it is not. But it's damn close. This is an engrossing film all around. Its soundtrack and cinematography are remarkable, and even though the movie has little dialogue, the characters motivations and body language speak louder than words. Drive manages to be extremely violent, subtle and even romantic without ever shifting in tone.",10
2012-02-04,Loved it.,8
2012-02-03,Amazing film. Love the art direction and the soundtrack. A must see!,9
2012-02-04,"Beautiful to look at, but ultimately somewhat empty. Gosling's silent act is all very well, but leaves you emotionally uninvolved. The reasoning behind the decisions he makes is never clear. Agreeing to help Standard then still pulling his 'I just drive' quote in particular jars - is he planning on going back to Irene and saying 'yeah, he was 30 seconds late so I left him behind'? It's still a solid genre piece, but could have been great if someone had told them that less isn't always more.",6
2012-02-04,"One of the most impressive films I've watched in a while and probably one of the best action movies I've EVER seen, and I have to say I'm not a big fan of action movies.

Gosling definitely deserved at least an Oscar nomination, too bad it didn't happen.",9

2012-02-04,What can I say that hasn't already been said? One of those films that has to be watched. Sumptuously gorgeously understated. The relationship between Ryan Gosling's 'driver' and Carey Mulligan's Irene was simply electric. I didn't want it to end!...,8
2012-02-04,"Some film’s try really, really hard to be cool and/or iconic. Whether it through casting, music or being overly violent, they try desperately hard to be something that will stay in the minds of everyone who sees it.

There is no guarantee how Danish director Nicolas Winding…",10

2012-02-05,Big case of style over substance. Every other shot was a pensive slow-mo shot. It just got a bit boring after a while. And why is it that nobody could talk properly? It took 10 minutes just to get a few sentences into a conversation...,5

,Great music and beginning but the film gets a bit lost until the end.,7
2012-02-04,"I approached this movie with a negative attitude right off the bat– mostly because everyone else was saying how much they loved it. Also, this was going to be the first Gosling film I'd seen, and I was tired of hearing every woman I know raving over him and The Notebook. ",9
2012-02-05,"While I'm not as insanely in love with this film as many of my cinephile brethren are, it is a superior action film that actually manages to draw you into the lives of its characters. Very well done.",8
2012-01-31,Favorite film of 2011. The coolness.,10
2012-02-05,Nicolas Winding Refn is becoming one of my favorite directors. It's a shame Albert Brooks didn't get reconized by the Academy. He owns every scene he's in.,10

,"Loved it.. a bit violent, but Ryan Gosling is super good..very atmospheric and definitely worth seeing!",7
,"Simply bad ass. Gosling, Mulligan, and especially Brooks were all three denied deserving oscar nominations. One of the more stylish films I've seen in a while. Top notch soundtrack. Not for those with weak stomachs. Drive was the best movie I saw in 2011 hands down. if you find yourself enjoying this as much as I did, check out Winding Refn's earlier film ""Valhalla Rising.""",8
2012-02-06,"All movies can take a lesson from DRIVE. A beautifully delivered story. Simple, yet stunning. Everything blends well here (story, acting, directing, music) to deliver one hell of a great film. I wish more movies were like this. Story is key, always.",10
2012-02-06,Drive beautifully highlights the difference between 'action' and 'tension'. It also wonderfully shows how both can be exhilarating.,10

2012-01-24,"Mesmerizing. Very much a retro pastiche. But it isn't smug or obnoxious about being that. It seems to have been beamed in from an alternate universe.

,"Nicely styled, but the difference in audio was quite frustrating",8
,This movie had a lot of hype and although it was good I didn't think it was that great. The hyper violent scenes come out of know where and I overall feel that they made the movie worse. I also wasn't a big fan of the soundtrack.,6
,"An unexpectedly dark story, where the director seemingly skipped over a bit of relationship development in order to make room for the dismal plot. I did enjoy the development of Ryan Gosling’s somewhat mysterious character, who is slowly revealed to be just as grim as the happenings that befall him.",7

2012-01-21,"One of those unique films that catches you by surprise. The atmosphere created by the minimal dialogue from the main protagonist combined with the excellent soundtrack was definitely a major plus for the film. It certainly had a Taxi Driver-esque feel to it (one of my all-time favorite flicks), and it simply a well constructed movie. It's really easy to mess up a film like this and it could so easily have been boring - but that's what good film-making is all about...pulling off a masterstroke such as this.",8

It started off quiet, peaceful and extremely boring, only to quickly morph into a graphically violent, predictable movie. The only reason it doesn't end up in my pile of ""Worst Movies Ever"" is due to the way it was carefully and beautifully shot. You're better off skipping this one and buying the soundtrack.",4

2012-02-08,"Fantastic. Superbly directed and acted. Still a bit undecided on whether the OTT ultra violence really fits the tone of the rest of the movie, i'm not saying it was ""too violent"" or anything Daily Mail-esque, but just not sure whether the violence needed to be of the splatter variety, although it was really well done, it kind of took me out of the film just a bit.",10
,One of the best films I have seen in some time. Definitely was not what I had expected. Also a very well done score.,9

,It was a challenge to determine what my number one film of the year was. Some years are easier than others and this year fell on the difficult side.

My appreciation for Drive has grown even greater long after I watched it…,10

2012-02-11,"I see what they were trying to do, but unfortunately it just didn't come together for me. The cinematography was of high quality, but the dramatically extended frames and the breaks in dialogue often seemed forced. Thankfully, at times, this silence was relieved by a great soundtrack.",6
2012-02-11,"This is the second time I have watched this movie. Decided to watch again as it's been on my mind and it really is superb. Brought tears to my eyes twice, very touching. The simple touching of hands turned me to mush. Gosling is superb. The bad guys are superb. The tension in the opening credits is nerve jangling. The lighting in the elevator scene really gobsmacked me, it seemed to induce a tunnel vision and I was sucked right…",9
,A fantastic movie and my fave of 2011. How this was not nominated for a shit-ton of Oscars is beyond me!,10
2012-02-04,"If you like early-mid '80s action/thrillers, this is ripped from that time - the look, the music, even the credits font screams early Michael Mann. It has it's problems (mostly first-act), but I liked it nonetheless.",7
2012-02-12,"An amazing film, might be my favorite of 2011. And it's very different from almost anything Hollywood has been feeding for years.",9
,"One of the best of 2011 and one of three films from that year that, for this viewer, clinches Ryan Gosling as a must watch for any future projects.",10
,"The coolest, if not the best flick of 2011.",9
2012-02-10,"Reminiscent of 80's dramatic action films like Friedken's ""To Live and Die in L.A."" or Mann's ""Manhunter."" An oddly captivating film.",8
,"The hype train has left the station, but this is still a pretty great movie. Deeply regret jumping the gun and calling it the best of 2011 though, and doing so before seeing some of the many bounties that year had to offer",8
,"The title, Drive, left me expecting fast-paced action. I was waiting for the movie to take off until about half way through when it became apparent that it wasn't going to. That said Drive was positively fantastic at building suspense, the sound was fantastic, but in the end the pacing left me a bit displeased - probably because it wasn't what I expected.",7
2012-01-08,A well-crafted adrenaline ride with a fantastic set of supporting characters. Pulling together other aspects such as racing and stunt driving opened the film up to enormous possibilities. Ryan Gosling would also go on to star in a film where he is given a speaking role. ,10
2012-02-13,And you have proved to be a real human being. And a real hero.,10
,My favorite film of 2011.,10
,"Great Sound, Nice Movie, Great Screenplay",7
,"As the anticipation built from seeing the trailer for the first time, up to the moment when the opening scenes began, I have to say that this film took me into an unexpected journey that in the end left me immensely satisfied. With an amazing cast that in their subtlety took each character deeper, and could really only be appreciated by watching the nuances of their expressions, ""Drive"" transcended far beyond its dialogue. Managing to create a story that in…",8
2012-02-12,"Finally saw this crazy (and captivating!) film! It was a real ""slow burn"" of a movie, and one which left me completely enthralled. Haven't been able to stop thinking about it and it's slow ride into insanity since I saw it last night.",9
,"Awesome movie, it surprises you in every scene, it's amazing how it goes from an action movie to a love story to a thriller to a gory thing. It's like John Hughes trough the eyes of Tarantino. ",10
,"So stylish, so sexy and an incredibly surprising slow burn that really detonates near the end.",9
2012-02-13,Was a good film. I enjoyed it... But however I was hoping for a bit more...,7
,"Sure, the film was stylish as all hell, and Albert Brooks was a revelation. That still doesn't excuse the humdrum plot, cliched characters, and inexplicable performance by Ryan Gosling. Here's the clincher, though: watch the film again, only this time assume Gosling's driver has a developmental disorder. Suddenly the whole mess makes a lot more sense.",6
,"It's stylish, and features an enigmatic performance by Gosling, but the whole thing left me a bit cold.",5
,"If Charade is the best film HItchcock never made, then Drive is the best film that Michael Mann never made. I love the look of the film, the acting, mise-en-scene, music. What a blast.",10
2012-02-14,"Two stars. 1.5 for the movie, 0.5 for RG's Canadian tuxedo.",4
,"2nd watch BLURAY, stunningly beautiful,so amazing in it's choices to be quiet when playbook says go loud, Love this Flix",8
,"This film was awesome. This movie is the perfect example of a film that is all about the direction. I love movies that are simple but done differently and paced on the slower side. Ghost Dog comes to mind when watching this. Awesome cinematography and slow motion used brilliantly. The plot is very basic, a little on the weaker side, but because the direction is so superb, you're kept very intrigued. Albert Brooks was good. He wasn't nominated for this…",8
,"Loved it on first viewing, liked it even more second time around. Pretty much everything I want from a movie.",10
2012-02-13,"The action sequences are fantastic, but everything in between is too slow!",4
,"I don't really understand some of the criticism this has gotten for being boring...I've seen it multiple times now, and have enjoyed it more and more each time.",9
2012-02-16,"Stylistically superb and well crafted piece of cinema right here. Many shots reminded me of Lynch, and even some of the (some say) over the top graphic violence reminded me of Wild At Heart. Some of the shots, especially in the car sequences and how it followed Gosling's line of sight were really great. Refn admits to making ""Genre"" films and this is definitely one, but even in moments where I thought ""this is a film student's wet dream"" it instilled in me the aura of truly great cinema. Check it.",8
,So overrated.,6
2012-02-02,"Want to see the film that Michael Mann should have made between ""Thief"" and ""Manhunter"" instead of the mess that was ""The Keep""? Well here it is.",9
2011-12-14,One of the best films of 2011. To say more would be to spoit it. Just watch it and enjoy it. Love the soundtrack also...,9
2012-02-02,"@CineStar SonyCenter, Berlin (OV)One of the finest actiondramas I have ever seen, fantastic directing by Nicolas Winding Refn and acting by Ryan Gosling. Looks and sounds great as well (wonderful score/soundtrack).",10
2011-12-23,Brilliant. The best film I have seen in a long time. Great sound track. Ryan Gosling is super cool. One of the best car chasing scenes ever.,9
,"Hm, acting was cool, but the movie completely lost me after the first half.",3
2011-09-17,"Pretty near a flawless film for me. It's honestly hard for me to find fault with much of anything. The relationships between the characters are great, particularly with Gosling and Mulligan (I think I'm in love with her) who say so much without even uttering a word of dialogue and the action is fantastic. I mean the opening sequence sets the tone for the entire film; a drive through the streets of LA with barely a word of dialogue, just…",10
2012-02-16,A _very_ pretty movie with beautiful light and depth of field.,6
2012-02-15,"An outstanding, stylish piece of work, Drive is one of the most compelling films I've seen in years. Violent, noirish, and suffused with a sense of 80s cool without ever seeming like a pastiche, the film is dominated by a superb performance from Ryan Gosling, whose nameless Driver is clearly indebted to, but bears comparison with, Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name. The pacing, plot and painstaking photography are all spot on, and best of all is the wonderful electronic score that flips between spaced-out ambience and thudding neo-electropop. An absolute treat on every level.",10
2012-01-26,"The cinematography is stunning, from the 'in-car' sequences to the lighting its gorgeous to look at. Audio-design is raw and vigorous, and the soundtrack and score are great. Gosling and Mulligan's performances are completely surpassed by Albert Brooks and Byran Cranston. Meanwhile the story is straight-forward and has some intense moments. It's definitely one of 2011's best, but some ""awkward"" pacing slightly ruins it.",8
,Gosling's driver is a curious mix of shy sweetness and dead-eyed psychosis. You wouldn't want to cut him up on a roundabout.,7
2012-02-14,"Nicolas Winding Refn has quickly become my favorite director over the last couple years, and Drive did not disappoint. Someone tweeted that this movie was basically a music video for Ryan Gosling's face. While there might be some truth to that, it's also an intense and suspenseful movie that's easily my favorite film of 2011.",9
,Great flick. Refn & Gosling at the top of their respective games. Top film of 2011.,10
,"An intelligently paced, stylistic action movie with a focus on characterization. The throwback to the 80s was great.",9
,"Watched this now 4 times. This is a film student's wet dream, beautifully lit, dark, ominous characterization, loud hipster soundtrack, heavy score, lots of gore.",9
,"The movie that boosted Gosling, a little romance between the violence and supported by a killer '80s electronica soundtrack.",8
,one of my new favorites. blows transporter etc out of the water. It's at a whole new level.,9
,"""buckle up because the dialogue in DRIVE is also minimal but all of the content and visuals pack enough punch to give anyone a severe case of whiplash""",9
2012-02-11,"Don’t watch this like me expecting a dizzying story with superb character development. Instead, watch this expecting a gritty and striking mood with thrilling and gripping performances from Ryan Gossling, Albert Brooks, Carey Mulligan, and the ever-dependable Walter White, er Bryan Cranston.",8
2011-10-12,Drive proves that 'style over substance' can sometimes be a good thing.,7
,Slow start. Several awkward interactions between characters. Second half of movie was much better. A few gory scenes not for the faint hearted.,7
,"what the fuck, for real?",1
2012-02-12,"The most discussed movie of the year, and with reason. This is only the second movie I've seen from Refn and again i was stunned. Not so much by the story, but the way every scene was visually brought to the screen is just amazing to say the least. The main character 'The Driver' is not a man of words but of deeds. Some of the staring contest scenes will prove so ;). Some will probably think the whole 'silent'…",9
,"Someone once said ""If you can't find at least something you like about this film, there is something wrong with you"". I believe that with all my heart.",10
2012-02-21,So ridiculously good. Extremely cool. Brilliant.,9
,"A modern day fairytale, Drive carefully balances cool retro-pastiche, captivating character studies and wince-worthy violence to present 100 minutes of cinematic gold.Clean visuals bring the gripping car chases and sporadic busts of aggressive action to life, but director Nicolas Winding Refn keeps the same attention on the more intimate moments.Backed up by a criminally cool soundtrack of 80s inspired melodies, Drive shifts modern film-making into top gear.",9
,"After all the hype, I was disappointed. I liked the idea and the atmosphere of the film, but it felt poorly executed. There were far too many holes and the contrast of good actors and bad actors made the bad acting really stand out.",6
,"Drive"" is, aesthetically speaking, an early Michael Mann movie.  It's a small doomed little character piece, with Ryan Gosling giving a great movie star performance, self-aware and stylized to an extreme. ",8
2012-01-18,Different but very tasty.,9
2012-02-11,Face-stompingly brilliant and great soundtrack. Gosling is perfect as the quietly smiling driver whose inner violent hero is let loose. Great sound editing as well eg the creak of Gosling's leather gloves,9
,"This is a very strong film that gets most of it's power from it's un-ending grip on atmosphere. Nick Winding-Refn really knows how to create mood, character and a very powerful atmospheric dirge like vibe (with the help of his brilliant composer Cliff Martinez). Ryan Gosling has easily entered the super-star zone with this role. He is simply fantastic and amazingly under-stated as ""Driver"". I love we never knew his name. Less is definitely MORE here as the NON-style morphs…",8
,"A movie very capable of stirring emotion. Some of the best use of music to enhance story that I've experienced in film. It enhances the dream-like state of the movie and helps create the feeling of a modern, improved version of the 80s, somehow captured on film. Plus, all of the driving scenes are exhilarating.",10
2012-01-31,Not enough words can describe how much I love this movie!,10
,Braindead action movie but not Oscar worthy in my opinion.,5
,"Underrated film but finally getting the accolades it deserves. Dark, thrilling story. Great cinematography & love the way it was shot. Sound track is also top notch.",8
,Definitely my favourite film of 2011. Can't believe it wasn't nominated for more oscars.,10
,"Another movie that I liked a lot more a few days after I saw it. Advertised totally wrong, however, this was a powerful drama beautifully shot and artfully choreographed. Ryan Goesling just proves that he can not say a word and still be amazing. Great cameo by Christina Hendricks as well.",7
,Best film of 2011. Came out of nowhere and blew me away. Film making at its best,10
2012-01-28,Dazzling neo-noir set in contemporary LA. Gosling and Mulligan are underplayed to perfection as doomed would-be lovers. Full review: tinyurl.com/7gtrbvj,10
2012-02-22,"The intro made me think of GTA Vice City. Maybe because of the music or the plain wrong fonttype they used for the credits :) I loved that game. I like this movie. Beautiful scenes and a stone cold Ryan Gosling: ""Do you want a toothpick?""...",8
,"Hard-hitting, smooth-flowing, ultra-cool thriller with a great 80s throwback feel.",8
,Best Film of 2011!!!,10
,"Intense, atmospheric, clever, extremely violent and simply fantastic. The sound track really made the film too",10
2011-09-17,"The relationships between all the characters were great, without having to spend much time on them. We could feel what was going on without even being told. I loved that Gosling's character was quiet and soft spoken, thinking and feeling without having to explain.",10
2012-02-10,"Love it. When I first saw this in the theater, I thought that everyone would love this movie. Then I heard someone walking out say that it was boring. That's when it hit me - I must be turning into a movie snob, because it never occurred to me that anyone would not like this movie. I then realized how slow, deliberate, and arty this film really was.",10
2011-10-11,Jesus wept! this is ... this is ... ehm ... no ... whhooooohoooo!!!,9
,"Ryan Rosling plays the loner with no name, a stunt driver working part time as a mechanic and as a getaway driver or vice versa. It's a film noir drenched in sunlight: Elegant, beautiful and ultra violent. Utterly compelling!",10
,"I thought of American History X mixed with Natural Born Killers when watching parts of this movie. Gosling is able to say plenty throughout the film without saying a word. I look forward to the sequel, ""Neutral.""",7
2012-02-10,"I've seen this film twice now. I missed it in theatres, which is a damn shame, because I REALLY enjoyed it. This is probably the best film of 2011 that I didn't see until 2012. :)",9
2012-01-31,"There's something about this movie that bugs me and I can't figure out what it is. Watch it twice you'll see things you didn't see the first time. Overall though the movies quite good, its very much a film makers film.",6
,"Sure, the soundtrack will make you want to rush out to buy some leather pants and throw a homoerotic 80s dance party, but then someone gets their face blown open and blood gushes out and you're all like, ""Dude, Joan Holloway is still sexy as trailer trash covered in chunky gore,"" and you know you have a problem. Was the popcorn laced with acid? Did someone slip you a mickey?",8
,"The sexiest film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is intriguing, melancholic, passionate, sweet, and raspy.Lots of action and bloody scenes.....(spoil) mind blowing kiss in the elevator.",10
,"awesome movie, with great soundtrack and actors",10
2011-09-20,"This isn’t a film, it’s a work of art. From the first shot you’re taken out of your boring life and plummeted into a world where everything looks fantastic. This film was made on a shoe string but you wouldn’t guess it. LA looks as glamorous as ever and this is heightened by the cacophonous soundtrack that fits perfectly. The opening chase sequence sets the scene, this film isn’t hanging around. It clocks in at around 90 minutes. The director…",10
2012-02-24,"While far too many films these days rehash the same concepts and premises in the same ways over and over again, Drive accomplishes the rare feat of taking story tropes that we think we are familiar with and blazes its own trail. Not to mention that every performance is aces. I could watch Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan stare at each other for hours.",10
,"Like a visceral modern redux of the Melville classic, Le Samourai, Drive is a bracing, contemplative thriller that flows poetically, and not like a series of mindless action setpieces. The film is expertly paced, thoughtful, incredibly well-acted, enthralling and intense. One of 2011's best, for sure.",10
,"Surprising, not the typical bloody-action story in the city of Los Angeles. I loved it, it's like it brought me to the 80's, especially with the awesome soundtrack. Excellent cast, acting, and sound editing. Very original to have involved the story of The Scorpion and the Frog, making you understand the Driver. I would say it was an extraordinary ride at the cinema. My favorite movie of 2011.",10
2012-02-24,"I have never liked Ryan Gosling more than I do now after watching this film. He brought a quiet power to the role that was so intriguing. Slow but very precise in all the best ways. It had me at the opening scene, I just wish there was a bit more like that beginning.",9
2012-02-24,"""Shane"" - horses + cars = ""Drive""",8
2012-02-26,"The treatment of this film was amazing. It's not for the faint-hearted. The cinematography, the direction, the lighting created such an intense atmosphere, it just heightened the whole experience. ",9
2012-02-26,"I thought this film was fantastic. Not what I (like most people) was expecting. In fact, two guys sitting near me got up and left about 10 min into the film. The trailer and the marketing make this film very misleading.",10
,"I love the director, but Ryan Gosling's character is so anoying, it ruined the film. he needed a slap",4
2012-02-25,So cool i nearly had a cine-gasm,9
2012-02-27,"Photography, understated emotive performances, sparse dialog and brutal violence all are plus in this film. It is very tense throughout; taught, not a roller-coaster ride of emotion. Yet the plot is a bit too simple. Good thing it is short, but it could've been shorter.",7
2012-02-25,"Every so often I get disillusioned with everything coming out of Hollywood. Luckily, every so often, something amazing like DRIVE comes along.",10
2012-02-24,"Um, yeah, ""Drive"" really isn't for me... I dont care that it is going after the style and feel of films like Michael Mann's ""Thief"" or that Gosling harnesses Steve McQueen's cool in ""Bullitt""... Everything about this just feels so fucking off... The obtrusive soundtrack, the awkward silences between Driver and Irene, Driver's incessant mumbling- it is all too achingly self aware and that affected my engagement negatively with this film. None of it feels like any fun and you…",5
2012-02-28,Odd love story I guess. Wonderful how the music and cinematography sets the tone. Loved it.,8
,I came to this film with zero expectation and came away pleasantly surprised. ,9
2012-02-17,"Danish Director, Nicolas Winding Refn is best known for his strangely stylised biopic of ‘Professional inmate’ Charles Bronson. ‘Bronson’ was the film which changed Tom Hardy’s film career & turned him from a bit-part player into ‘bankable’ leading man material.",9

2012-02-02,Well. I think I liked this less because I'd heard so much about it.,7
,"Neon Noir makes a comeback, one of the few 80's revivals that was worth having. Great film, director and star both reaching their full potential, can't wait to see what they do with Logan's Run.",8
,Essentially a perfect film.,10
2012-02-25,This was nothing like I expected which was why I enjoyed it so much. The long dialogue sparse scenes especially were something different and therefore enriched the movie. ,8
2012-01-29,I honestly didn't think I would enjoy this film but it has such interesting characters and so many different elements that make the film a roller coaster ride. It starts out as a high tension car chase scene which is told very cleverly. It then goes straight to an almost innocent love sequence between the Driver and his next door neighbor. Then the tension starts to rise again and because you care so much about the characters you can't help…,10
,Pleasantly surprised! Subtle acting and storytelling coupled with really stylish camera work. Reminds me of Tarantino without as many pop culture references. The soundtrack choices could be seen as cheesy but when thought of in the context of an 80s homage it works quite nicely.,7
2012-02-03,Best film of 2011...and Bizarro 1987,9
2011-09-25,"Probably the best surprise from 2011. Some may be turned off by its slow build up but that's one of the things that makes this so powerful. Everything can be so calm one mintue and the moment violence pops out of nowhere, it feels like some nightmare out of a David Cronenberg film. Nicholas Winding Refn creates one of the best films of the decade. Beautifully directed, body gyrating soundtrack, well acted (though Carey Mulligan seems miscast), pulse pounding action, and it has probably one of the best car chases to ever grace the screen.",10
2012-03-01,"Simple, slow paced and crafted to perfection by Nicolas Winding Refn. Loved it. Can't wait to watch it again.",10
,Ryan Gosling becomes an icon.Stone cold classic,10
,Gosling is great. Soundtrack also get 4.5 stars. must see,9
,"Nice soundtrack, but a somewhat thin story.",8
,Favourite film of 2011 from one of the most interesting directors working today.,10
,"Amazing movie, love the silent hero and the slow rhythm. The soundtrack is also fantastic and can't wait to read the book!",8
2011-10-20,"Moody, drifting, perfectly-scored and sporadically vicious tale of a psychotic getaway man who's far from being 'a real hero'.",9
,"I finally watched Drive in January. Whilst I enjoyed it, I didn't feel it lived up to all the hype. Yeah, that old problem. Still, it certainly has a style and pace all of its own.",8
2012-02-28,"What a knockout of a movie. Just moves like lightening but at a snail's pace. Such an understated, yet outrageous movie. I can't say enough about it. The violent yet operatic masterpiece with an amazing central performance by Gosling. Boggles the mind why it was ignored come award season.",10
2012-03-01,"Somewhat derivative of ""Thief"" in both story and tone, the director's slow, ""linger-on-the-scene"" style just barely works. The supporting cast makes this movie, in particular Bryan Cranston, and especially Albert Brooks, who should have gotten an Oscar nomination.",7
2012-02-25,"Wonderfully stylized film in which the Taxi Driver-esque feeling of automative solitude is combined with Tarantinoish intrigue and ultraviolence and the best soundtrack John Carpenter never made. Not much new here, but an Instant near-classic nonetheless.",10
2012-03-02,"Perhaps I should have seen it in the cinema, but I didn't feel immersed in this movie as I probably should have been. There's lots to like here, but the result came across as artificial to me. Pity.",6
2012-03-02,"A movie filled with long awkward pauses, and amazing visual affects. The entire movie feels like a cinematography art show that we are lucky enough to be apart of. The art style is crisp, sleek and cool with a color scheme that of Vice City even though this takes place in LA, though it is equally as mobbish. The story is solid enough and It truly is one hell of a ride no matter how cliché it is to say that. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8
2012-03-03,Nicolas Winding Refn can do no wrong. Everything about the film seemed to be placed to perfection. Never thought I'd enjoy the light off a lighthouse so much.,10
,Great art house noir film. Great acting.,10
,A gripping thriller with style and coolness to spare.,10
,"Wasn't nuts about the story, but visually this is one hell of a movie.",8
2012-03-04,No surprise to those that have followed Nicolas Winding Refn's danish film carreer. He might be exactly what is needed in Hollywood right now. Drive is possibly the real anti-thesis to Quentin Tarantino's super-aestheticized films - the Antitino of stylized crime and violence. The important difference lies in the very real emotional impact. Near perfect filmmaking.,10
2012-03-04,Nicolas Winding Refn's amazing Drive. Sheer brilliance and a film which I'll be revisiting plenty over time! Ryan Gosling is phenomenal.,10
2011-10-07,"Digitally photographed crime thriller shot on location in L.A. Very atmospheric, in the manner of Michael Mann's COLLATERAL (2004). The lead characters don't talk a lot, but communicate via gestures, facial expressions, body movements. It's quite compelling for the first two thirds, but turns into standard crime show cliches towards the end, in the final confrontations with the two main villains. I wanted a little more imagination in the resolution. Worth seeing, but not as good as all the hype would have you believe. COLLATERAL is much better.",6
2012-02-10,"Not what I was expecting at all, but a million bazillion gillian times better.",10
2012-03-04,"I finally saw it on the big screen last night and although I knew exactly what was going to happen in every scene, it was an even more impressive experience than my first two viewings. If I could give it six stars, I would!",10
2012-03-04,"Finally got round to seeing this pretty fun, highly predictable, seeming homage to 70s/80s LA crime flicks. Gosling is mesmerising, everyone else, meh. Refn scores another highly stylised hit for me, but its no Bronson.",8
,"Ryan effin Gosling. The film itself is interesting enough, though I'm starting to believe that RG can only really play one type of character (SEXY but one-dimensional perfect man.... sigh) when there is even the hint of a romance in the storyline.",6
,Good. I'm enjoying refn's films so far.,8
,Great!,10
,One of the better flicks of 2011. Albert Brooks is mad dope as a cold blooded mob-boss...,8
,Not bad but not what the trailer promised,7
,Great film. Loved it. Spent days thinking about it afterwards. My most enjoyable movie for 2011,7
2012-03-02,High expectations can kill a film but not one that moves this quickly. Refn finds new beauty in neon-lit scenes of murder and horsepower driven adventure. More on the site.,10
,Loved the harsh contrast between the delicate relationship and the cruelty.,10
,"Soulless and sick. And not as in slang for cool. Though, stylistically, it is. Very. An expressionless Gosling is meant to be cool, too. He doesn't give a bad performance; in fact he hardly gives one at all. Anybody would, admittedly, appear bland opposite Cranston and (a quite phenomenal) Brooks. The largest problem is the gore, ostensibly there to communicate that Driver's nature prevents him from being with Irene. That his violence is unnecessarily glorified is just not cool. -½ for the font.",7
,"NOT the masterpiece it's been made out to be, it's one of those films that's good because of the soundtrack and the atmospherics but when it comes to dialogue and script, meh!",7
,Film of 2011.,10
2012-02-08,"Perfectly fine, but the adulation this has received has actually turned me off this. Much like Bronson, it's a shiny, empty thing that slips from your grasp if you try and look at it for too long; it's also style over substance once removed: it references nothing but films, and filmic ideas.",5
,"Amazing. perfect score, and great pace. highly recommended",9
,One of the best films I saw in 2011.,10
,Absolutely loved it. Done.,9
,"pretty aggressive visuals which help set the tone of the movie, but are non the less, pretty vivid and heavy. the mood and subtle nuances of the film give it a unique and enticing appeal, not to mention a superb soundtrack",8
2012-01-30,"Who will give back my 100 minutes that I wasted on this movie? No one! This movie is hyped, everybody is enthusiastic about it, now it has come to German theatres... and I should've known! When people are writing about this ""own unique kind of excitement and thrill"" this movie builds up, there is only one way for it to turn out. ""Unique kind of thrill"" - I already saw this in ""Michael Clayton"" which had the same kind of thrill: none.",3
,"Favourite film of 2011. Absolute perfection. Great cast, AMAZING soundtrack, surprises, brilliant acting, perfect editing. Love, love, love.",10
,My favorite film of 2012. Had no idea what a great character/performance I was in for.,10
,"As much as people I know talked up this film, I just don't get it. Or maybe I do. It was shot well and the majority of the performances were good...EXCEPT Ryan Gosling. Sorry, I can't accept this boy-man as a badass. And he seemed semi-narcoleptic throughout the whole film. Which is how I felt after watching his ""performance.""",4
2011-11-05,"The best film I saw in 2011 was, fittingly, a 2011 film. 'Drive' just doesn't force you to stare at its impossibly-beautiful shots and tap to its slick, pulsating soundtrack... No, it literally demands you to buckle up for your dear life - and the life of Irene and her ""Driver"" - or else you'll break through the windshield once this car begins to violently tumble down the hill.",10
,"Stunning film with a sensational 80's vibe. Gosling on fantastic form (man crush alert) with great co stars in Cranston and Brooks. Even if you don't like Drive, you'll come away with a need to own the soundtrack.",9
,"After revisiting this film a second time, I fell a little deeper in love with it. I wasn't so preoccupied by the music and stylized art work of every frame, nor was I as blind-sided at the drastic turns this movie and it's violence take. This time I was much more queued in, while challenging myself to decipher what makes this the great movie I believe it is. My first visit with the film, I felt it was pretty uneven…",8
2012-03-04,"Despite its early marketing and the lasting impressions it leaves with people, this is a film all about delicacy. It starts in predictably stylish manner but quickly cedes ground to a dreamy, almost mesmerizing portrait of a closely connected group of people, all longing for the quiet life.",8
2012-03-08,"If DRIVE was a person, we'd have a short passionate relationship which would end with me dead and/or DRIVE vanishing into thin air.",10
,"If you went to the theater expecting a mindless action movie, then you went at the wrong movie. ""Drive"" exemplifies what many movies should be doing; which is providing a stylistic rendition of what a Hollywood movie should be. The acting was superb and even though the emotions of ""Driver"" were well hidden at times; they were deeper that one might imagine. ""Drive"" is definitely on the top of my 2011 list, along with the powerful soundtrack which fits each scene perfectly.",10
,"Oozes style. Great cast, great performances, fantastic cinematography and an even better soundtrack. Gets violent, bring a towel.",8
2011-09-25,"Nicolas Winding Refn's tale of a getaway driver forced to take a stand when he's drawn into a situation involving mobsters, hit men, ex-cons and double crosses may not be the deepest film. There's no deep bond between a man and his favorite animal, Nazis don't show up, there are no terminal diseases or grant metaphorical understandings. That doesn't mean it's not a great film. As much as The Artist is a love letter to the silent film era or…",9
2012-03-04,"The idea of the Existential Driver / lone samurai warrior device is used to good effect in this film, and it's got Ron Perlman in it.",8
,"Plays like a slick, occasionally gory car commercial; stylishly directed, but Gosling's blank expression and stretches of silence left me wanting more. Albert Brooks deserved his accolades for his fine work, but Carey Mulligan was utterly wasted.",5
2012-03-08,"Slow, moody crime drama with a good soundtrack, kind of like a reincarnation of ""American Gigolo."" While it did have its rewards, I can't imagine ever returning to this one.",6
2012-03-05,"As they say a modern ""film noire"", nothing more, nothing less. Some scenes are a bit exaggerated, but the story is good.",9
,"Amazing film that I had zero knowledge of going on. Kind of surprised by the hyper-violent bits, but overall a pretty incredible storytelling experience, done a lovely slow, deliberate way.",9
2012-03-09,"Drive is a very clever and well made film. It sings of 80’s style and reeks of cool, but also has substance. It always feels like it’s playing it safe but in fact the conventions are being thrown away, the rulebook rewritten, every step of the way. The actors are all on fine form, especially when you consider how little dialogue they all have. The director gets the most credit though, for keeping the right balance of everything that this film is about while keeping it looking beautiful. My one criticism though, could have done with a lot more thrills.",8
,So good or maybe I should say I was won over by its coolness and 80s feel. I think the soundtrack made me forget that not much really happens.,8
,Breathtaking and stunning. Visually it is amazing due to fantastic cinematography. Definitely a film that showcases the director's talent but that doesn't imply that all actors involved don't give great solid performances. The sound is absolutely perfect throughout the film and the music fits the movie like a glove. Captivating and riviting it is definitely one of the best of the year. After a second viewing I will expand my review I'm sure.,9
,"There will not be a cooler movie released in 2011. No question. Nicolas Winding Refn's European sensibilities mixed with odes to American B-cinema is sloshed around to perfection here. It runs on a bare story and script, but ts substance is the myriad of styles its evoking: from the Euro colors, to the 80's type vibe in the soundtrack, to the indie type smiles and silences, to the B-movie love applied to cars and jackets, gory violence, and really bad…",10
,Ryan Gosling stares expressionlessly into space...,5
,"Not for the typical movie-goer, but this movie is a beautiful blend of the arthouse and action genres.",8
,By far one of the best movies released last year.,10
2012-03-11,"Quality film, Gosling is fantastic, the car chases are electric. Be warned though, this film is very violent, so not one for the squeamish!",9
,A beautiful movie with a wonderful soundtrack.,10
,Best Movie of 2011.,10
2012-03-02,its a good movie. i like that fact that ryan has a few lines,8
,"A artistic drama, action, suspense. Wonderful performance by all actors. Must see for every filmy.",7
,"Once you realize that you`re watching a drama rather than an action flick, Winding Refns stunning and hypnotizing camera work and the nostalgic 80s soundtrack really pull you in. Refn shows how you can craft an outstanding film from a rather dull and uninspired script. The few scenes of violence are very quick, dirty and incredibly gory. A must-watch if you liked Valhalla Rising. If you didn`t, stay away from Drive.",9
2012-03-09,Already one of my favourite films of all time. Everything about this film just oozes cool.,10
,"What i liked about this is that if it was left to any old director it would of been a cliched and forgotten film, it's not that. What i didn't like about this film is it's basically soft music and Ryan Goslings silent face for about 90% of the time he's in shot.",6
,"Well rounded, great storytelling, and a great ride without driving you crazy. Who knew there were still heroes?",9
,"My favorite newer movie I've seen recently. The soundtrack is great too, works wonders for the vibe and feel of the whole film. I wish Christina Hendricks was in it more, but that's personal.",10
,"So, DRIVE. Everyone seemed to go bananas over this movie and it just didn't do anything for me. It didn't piss me off (other than the music) and I appreciated the performances (though I'm still very lukewarm on Ryan Gosling, despite having seen him in tons of stuff), but my response can basically be summed up in one word: Meh.",5
2012-02-24,Not a massive fan of Ryan Gosling but he is proper cool in this film. Enjoyed it immensley and cant recommend it high enough. Get the soundtrack and watch it again!!,10
2012-03-01,"Exciting movie, brilliant actors, fabulous OST.",10
,"Drive is one of 2011 best films. A stylish film with great soundtrack. Ryan Gosling is a excellent actor, at least in this film.",8
,Excellent film. Great soundtrack. Ryan Gosling = awesome. Carey Mulligan = lovely.,8
,"For the majority of its running time, Nicholas Winding Refn and Hossain Amini’s pared-down crime thriller features the purest kind of cinematic iconography, using classic elements from the past thirty years of movies to create their simple tale of a getaway driver doing the wrong thing to protect the wholesome girl. It’s a glorious painting done in primary colours, depicting a luminous LA in which our near-silent anti-hero – a professional from the Michael Mann / Walter Hill school of…",8
2012-02-29,"An enjoyable movie, but it didn't blow me away in the same manner it apparently did some critics. The performances are spot on, especially Albert Brooks, who should have been recognized by the Academy for his performance. Ron Perlman, the best thing about so many movies, seems oddly miscast in this film. He's a little too larger than life in a movie that is about subtlety and small nuances. Still, well worth watching.",8
,"Stylish, beautiful & well scripted, Drive was easily the best film to come out of 2011. The art direction and cinematography are second to none. The soundtrack is implicitly good. The performances are strong, especially Ryan Gossling who shines through every scene. Everything about this film is note perfect. If you haven't watched it yet, put down your smart phone, get off your laptop, and do so. Now.",10
,"From making out in the rain to face stomping, I can't say this was the perfect role for Ryan Gosling.",8
,"Soundtrack, cinematography, acting, was just perfect. I thought this was going to be a racing movie but it completely proved me wrong the first few seconds with that low camera angle, i could never forget it. Gossling kicks such ass and he looks so fine doing it. If i could marry this film i would.",10
2012-03-13,"So sparse it's almost hard to take seriously (I assume that's why Ryan Gosling keeps smiling). Drive is a brilliantly constructed, evocative film, but a little overrated.",8
,The elevator sequence was jaw droppingly AWESOME!!!,8
2012-03-15,Two words....fucking amazing!!!,10
2012-03-16,"Loved this movie. Scarface, Transporter and Halloween all wrapped into one. Gosling has really come into his own to find good movies to be in.",9

,"Man was this movie a breath of fresh air! I loved this movie, Gosling was great in a sort of restrained way and with all the over the top villains seen in movies nowadays Albert Brooks was spectacular in his role. My favorite part of this movie(apart from my favorite scene where the 'Driver' walks up to Nino's Pizzeria and has a look inside while Nino is busy entertaining guests) was the soundtrack, from the moment the movie starts the…",8
,My favorite film of 2011,10
,"I watched Winding Refn’s ‘Valhalla Rising’ last year during a very strange time in my life. Miles from home, alone in a faceless hotel room and inevitably pissed the film had a profound effect on me. It was eerie and compelling, an interesting, dreamlike mix of pregnant pauses and shocking violence. It probably wasn’t the best time for me to be watching it and I couldn’t decide if I liked it or not for a long time after. Strangely enough…",9
2011-09-25,Review incoming,8
,"Loved everything about it, especially the acting and music",9
,"Without a doubt the coolest film of last year, Gosling - ghostlike - moves through the film, righting wrongs, being A Real Hero, and...well, driving. Mulligan plays a fine supporting role as well, as the worried neighbour. ",9
2012-03-17,First rewatch of this excellent film. I'm pleased to announce that everything in my first review that was after I saw it in theaters still holds true.,10
,"Call me gay for Ryan Gosling. The man can act. This finish dude can direct. The story is weird enough. And with the soundtrack, supporting cast, and dynamic forward moving editing and pacing, this film taunts the ""Transporter"" yet takes a turn to crazy Run Lola Runville and fast!!",8
2012-03-18,"Not a second wasted with this film. The film is so good that I almost can't sit back and enjoy the individual scenes without looking forward to the next amazing one. It's really an experience, a feeling, watching Drive.",10
,"An amazing film, on so many levels. The look, the soundtrack, the reserved acting and the sudden, sharp violence. A tragedy it didn't find a wider audience, which it should do on DVD. (or VHS!)",8
,Why has the film been ignored? I LOVE it!,10
,There aren't enough words in a billion languages that can describe how awesome this film is!,10
2012-03-18,"2 scenes near the end bug me, but this is still a good watch for a 3rd time. Made with a 70's aesthetic with a super Clint-like antihero performance by Gosling. It doesn't skimp on the red stuff either, pleasingly.",8
2012-03-18,Brilliant! Great music. Tension throughout. Extremely violent moments.,10
,My favourite film of 2011,10
2011-12-29,"Such a slow burning film, punctuated by shocking moments of violence. The opening ten minute sequence is more gripping than any action sequence I've seen in years.",9
2012-02-04,"Superior character-drive drama, stylishly directed with a wonderful performances all around. The staccato violence is chillingly effective, brutal in its presentation but restrained in its frequency. Gosling is understated, Brooks is calculated and cunning, while Cranston's performance is the true standout (and heart of the film).",9
2012-02-26,Loved it. However I cant help but not want to jump on the bandwagon so il be interested to watch it again in about 3 years to see how it holds up.,8
2012-03-09,"Stylishly shot, well acted great soundtrack. Not a massive amount of driving. Closer to Resevoir dogs than Senna!",7
,"Yes, the style sometimes overpowers the narrative, but you can't deny this is a film that dares to rise above clichés, and have some depth and actual desire to be something more. Plus that jacket!",9
,Wow! Well-done Ryan! I'm sure your character action-figure is in the making... much like Kill Bill's. Love the art direction!!,9
,Very well done. One of the best movies of 2011.,9
2011-12-10,"I don't know why I love this movie so much. Was it the Driver character, the magnificent score by Martinez, or the ultra-violence scenes that Refn brought. All I know that, all of it was mixed into one great cinematic experience. Thrilling, emotional, and wicked.",10
2012-03-20,"Very stylistic film with some great and beautiful shots. Gosling is surprisingly good. Dialogue was a bit awkward to watch, but that kinda was intentional.",8
,I am in a quandary about this film. I appreciate the artistic style and tone of it and the acting is quite superb but I am not totally sure where it was going with things. It all seemed slow paced and bitty. I watched it at the time with my wife and admit even I found some of the violence a bit much and would have thought you could have equal effect with cut aways and sound. ,6
,"This was a good movie. A little slow at times, but it reminded me of the car movies of the 70's",8
,"Possibly the best film of 2011, criminally ignored by The Oscars and one of the best soundtracks to a movie ever.",10
2011-08-13,"By day, ‘Driver’ (Ryan Gosling) is a Hollywood stunt man, but by night he makes his real money in the criminal underworld as a top-flight getaway driver. When pretty, married next-door neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) is menaced by hoods, he steps in to protect her and her little boy, only to find himself in an escalating conflict between the local thugs and the Mafia. Little does he know that these same men are the ones bankrolling his racing future and…",8
2012-03-06,"Slow burning character thriller that gets better every time you watch it. Drive is just one of those films that grows on you like an addiction, you watch it the first time you pass it along, then the second time you like it more, up until you've watched it the 10th time in a week and you're selling your body just for another hit...well maybe not that bad of an addiction, but you understand the metaphor.",8
,BAHAHAH this fucking worthless film. It could've been something but it wasn't. ,2
,"Hollywood stunt driver by day, getaway driver by night. Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive portrays the stoic anti-hero brought to life in a career defining role for Gosling in this retro homage to the anti hero movies of the seventies with echos of George Steven's Shane. Propped up with an excellent support cast. Driver is one of the more interesting studio movies to come out of Hollywood in recent years and has a lot to say for it's self, unlike most…",9
,"Ryan Gosling is, in my opinion, not only one of the most talented, but most intense young actors working today. His performance in DRIVE is nothing short of dramatic, as his lines are limited, but his acting is not.",9
,Grossly overrated. I had high hopes.,4
,"Another of my favourite films of last year that shoots Refn from self-indulgent arthouse director into a more mainstream arena. Not that that's always a good thing, but in Refn's case, it most definitely is. Also good to see Gosling branch out from romantic roles into something a bit more gritty, showing that he actually is a diverse actor.Best soundtrack of the decade.",9
,"In this extraordinary tense thriller, Ryan Gosling plays a getaway driver who becomes involved in a gangster revenge plot. The driver is an extremely introverted, quiet character, full of silent thoughts rather than loud macho guff. An unusual creative choice but highly effective. Some long, quiet scenes are punctuated with truly horrific acts of violence and action setpieces and the resulting movie is a virtual masterclass in rising tension, visual action, and brilliant character development. Awesome.",8
2012-02-03,Now that is how you make a ruddy film!,8
2011-10-05,My film of 2011. One word... Elevating!,10
2012-03-23,"I was really keen to see this, but was kinda let down.",6
2012-03-26,Drive is a slow paced and subdued take on what would normally be a fast paced action film. Very interesting use of dialogue and shots give this film a very unique feel.,6
,Not sure what the critics see in this movie. It has it's moments but it drags... a lot.,5

,"Another strong performance for Ryan Gosling in a B Movie, celebrating B Movies - an homage to a number of films going back to the 70's.",6
2012-03-24,"Beautifully shot; lethargically paced. Ryan Gosling is a quiet gent who works as a mechanic and does some stunt driving/crashing on the side. When he tries to help out the husband of the woman he's fallen for, things go wrong and his driving (and ability to violently murder people) is put to the test. Great cast (Albert Brooks is totally bad-ass) and a cool soundtrack help make this one a must see. Yeah I know its a slow movie, but dammit, it is a good one too!",8
2011-12-28,"I have watched this movie at least twenty times thats how quality I believe it is. Every time I watch it I notice something different about it. From the beautifully framed shots to the murderous transformation. This film is a thrill ride every time you see it. It's not a must watch, it's a must watch again.",10
2012-03-09,"The film has a super cool vibe to it, beautifully put together and matched by a great soundtrack featuring the likes of Kavinsky (Nightcall sounds like it was written for the film).",6
,Good: photography and music,7
,Such a well paced film. Gosling's best. The soundtrack takes it from a 4 to a 5 star for me. Powerful and engrossing.,10
2012-03-27,"I thought it would be like Driver, without the r. It wasn't. I didn't buy Gosling as existential hero or psychopath. He said too much and too little. The real hero/real human being song symptomised the superficial nature of the film. Tell me how to feel, why don't you?",5
,"An incredibly beautiful, slow-paced film, with great moments of tension and near-poetic violence.",8
,"Slick and sophisticated, but some scenes too violent for me",7
,I know I'm in a very small minority but I just did not see the appeal of this. Admittedly slick but with very minimal substance and no real reason to become invested in the Driver's cause (although I did enjoy Bryan Cranston's character),4
,"Perfect genre piece. Standard ""one last heist goes wrong"" with nice pitch of moody 80s styling, and ultra-violence.",9
,"Gosling is a silent-driver-killer, yaay! Don't you dare to play with him.",8
,"Oh Lord. The music, the violence, the Gosling.",7
2011-09-07,Drive was one of my favorite films of 2011. It wasn't at all what I expected. Brilliant performance by Albert Brooks. Fantastic action with a real retro feel.,8
,"This film felt like it belongs in the company of other greats like Taxi Driver and Scarface. Its not often you feel like you've just watched an instant classic, its this year's Wrestler for me.",10
2012-01-29,"Kinda odd. It really feels like a movie that I would sit down to write. But for some reason that doesn't mean it's a movie I would love to watch. It was good, but something just keep it from being great. ",7
,"Really enjoyed this film on the whole, whilst the dialogue was a little on the quite side, the contrast between this and the moments of action and violence was fairly epic. Solid story and flowed well, although found the main character a little too withdrawn for such a sharp roll? Although not acted badly the character was in danger of appearing a little dim rather than just reserved.",8
,the best film of 2011. just as good 2nd time.,10
2012-03-29,"A lovely movie to watch while doing something else, for example talking to someone. Looks great, sounds great, acts great, not too much happening most of the time, not too much dialogue to pay attention to. Excellent! No, I'm not being sarcastic!",9
,Slow but stylish movie,7
,"A really amazing Neo Noir film. Not as much driving as I originally though, but loved the development and drive of the main protagonist. Ryan Gosling rebranded himself, IMO. The sound design really stuck with me, it was fantastic.",10
2012-03-30,Not quite sure on this as I feel asleep tired through most of it! The missus was raving about it so I'd better try it again sometime!,6
2012-03-29,Deliberate. That's the word I would use to describe this movie. The driver is deliberate and calculating. I felt a great sense of energy from this movie. Like this super tense stored up power waiting to explode in a laser-like precision.,8
2012-03-30,"Slightly predictable plot? Style over substance? Possibly, but when the style is this damn cool, who cares? Ryan Gosling is the Driver, a man with few words and a hot temper, navigating his way through the LA criminal underworld in a part arthouse, part exploitation thriller. With an achingly hip electro 80's tinged soundtrack and masterful direction, it's a travesty that this wasn't even nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.",9
2012-03-30,Final scene with the shadows always gets me.,10
,"This film.....this film. It has the pulp and texture of any great 70's street-flick to grace the world's screen, with a certain modern pulse. I don't know if it was the jewish mafia element or the guy from the notebook covered in a pervasive amount of blood element but something about this films stands so much taller than any driving movie or any revenge movie or any vigilante movie I've seen, perhaps, thus far. It has just the right amount…",10

,"From when I first saw THAT lift scene at Big Screen, Empires annual film festival, I wanted to see this film. Four months later I finally got the chance. The film tells the story of “the Driver” (Ryan Gosling) who works part time as a stunt driver for movies and part time as a getaway driver for criminals. He meets Irene (Carey Mulligan) who lives in the same apartment as him, they share an instant attraction to one another which…",10
2012-03-31,"""Drive"" is super-chic to look at and delivers an intriguing story of a stunt man who doubles up as a get away driver for the local crims. It's easy to be misled that ""Drive"" is a film of car chases and violent crime - it goes much deeper than that. The violence though, sits uneasy with the empathetic nature of the film's central character: there is a disconnect here that most reviewer's haven't really examined. Derivative of many elements that…",8
,"What an amazing piece of cinema, and it nearly snuck in under the radar! I was expecting some kind of low-grade action epic, but instead I got a stylish, slick, amazingly well played action-drama, with some truly memorable standout moments. No one is going to use the term ""high octane"" to describe Drive, but the words ""excellent"", ""cinematic"", ""gritty"" and ""stylish"" will turn up in abundance, and with the exception of some jarringly untalented strippers trying but failing to even be set dressing, this film has few flaws.",10

2012-04-01,"Drive gets a lot of hype, some deserved and some not so.",7
,"Overrated by some? Sure. Deserving of an Oscar? No (although entirely more worthy of a nomination than Extremely Loud And Incredibly Close). And although I feel like a few more viewings will yield a better opinion of some aspects of this movie (I'm still not sure if Gosling's performance is wooden or the best of his career), there's no denying that this is an unbelievably well-crafted film.",8

2012-04-02,Too cool. The films aesthetic is just amazing.,10
,Excellent soundtrack and good movie as well,8
2012-04-02,"Compelling and engaging even on 2nd viewing, the movie boasts great cast, direction, cinematography and soundtrack, while creating modern/timeless image of Los Angeles. Still, for me it's better observable from the distance, as one of the great cinema masterpieces that don't touch my heart.",8
2012-04-02,"This is a film Michael Mann could of made in the 80's with Mickey Rourke, cool, stylish, cold yet neon with a synth and bass. It's pretty darn good and it will still be standing long after other films made recently have slipped into oblivion.",8

,"DRIVE, in addition to being a top-notch thriller, is a master class in authorial voice. The story is basically genre boilerplate and features enough crooks, gangsters, car chases, and stand-offs to fill a half dozen Tarantino imitators, but the way director Nicholas Winding Refn approaches the material really breathes new life into the stock situations and characters. He is a talented enough director to make the film exciting, but the real revelation is that he can impose his personality so…",9
,Music and Ryan Gosling's face,7
,The soundtrack to this film is absolutely amazing. The film did feel a bit slow at times but the acting by Ryan Gosling just kicked it up a whole notch. Thought the ending could have been a lot better.,8
2012-04-04,Second time around and it's still bloody brilliant.,10
2012-04-04,"Drive feels like a lost Michael Mann film from the 1980's unearthed in the attic of your grandmother's house. If that were true, it would be a rich treasure. But it's not actually that. Is it an arty homage to that or is it its own thing? I can't really decide.",8
2012-03-12,"Ryan Gosling drives for a living. He's a mechanic, a stunt car driver (and potential racecar driver) but works there ""part time"". The rest of the time, he's a getaway driver for hoodlums. He falls for his neighbour (Carey Mulligan) whilst her husband is in prison. When he gets out, things between them get a bit complicated and Gosling ends up helping her husband out on a ""job"" that doesn't go to plan.",7

,"A film that certainly takes iits cue from Michael mann at times especially heat, and another film from the 80s by william frietkin. To live and die in la. the itself is moody and slow at times but in nob way a bad thing, it fits the story well, it also knows when to kick into gear when it wants to. the opening getaway sets mood perfectly and you will know what you are getting. Ryan gosling is great here…",10
,"Loved this movie, for some reason it reminded me of a Tarintino's movies, Gosling plays a mysterious role compared to his normal, romance type roles and does great. This is not ""Fast and the Furious"" this movie ACTUALLY has a story worth watching.",10
,The Gozz made this film,5
,"Being the last of the 3 ryan gosling movies i saw in 2011 this one stood out the most. Not only is Ryan Gosling a talented actor, he is extremely versitale. He played a comedic pimp (crazy stupid love) a strong willed campaign press secretary (Ides of march) and a tough silent type (Drive). He is one of the best in the business.",9

,"Looks great, like the film version of vice city. Quite relaxing.",8
2012-04-01,Loved everything about this film. An absolute breath of fresh air.,9
,"Ryan Gosling is the Driver, a stunt man who also takes jobs as a getaway driver, no questions asked. Taking a job to help a friend and get her husband off the hook, the proposed heist goes wrong and he finds himself a target. Cool, calm and collected, dressed in his iconic scorpion jacket, it’s easy to see why Gosling’s performance has been winning all the plaudits. But it’s Refn’s most accessible and accomplished film too, utterly confident, thrilling, and boasting a terrific synth soundtrack.",8

2012-04-09,What a smart and cool character!,9
,"Loved - The pacing, the story, the soundtrack, the imagery. Many people of the modern day fast living generation struggled to keep patience with this film but it's well worth a watch. The only problem I had with the storyline was the lack of development in the main character. As much as I loved him and his personality, I felt there was meant to be a lot more on his stunt driving than there was.",8
,Good but not the revelation I had been repeatedly assured it would be (predictably). Cartoon violence a bit jarring.  Could have done with at least 20% more Carey Mulligan. This is true of all films/life situations.,7

,One of the most original films I've seen in a long time. Definitely worth seeing if you like truly unique cinema.,9

Yet it has so so much much to offer; characters act like real people by not taking the movie cliche route. You can feel for Ryan Gosling's character…",9

His trademark jacket is a little out of date, but it says who he is without words.

2012-04-21,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Gosling looks retarded throughout the whole movie, there is no character development at all and cruelty just for the sake of cruelty. True, it was a bit interesting to see if it will go somewhere but if that's the kind of films that my generation will consider ""great"", then I am sorry for it.",4
,"Stunning thriller that manages to get a cool steel-like mood whilst also having a warmth that someone like Michael Mann seems unable to get. Gosling is great as a rather unlikely ""man with no name"" and all the supporting cast get it just right too. It's a very familiar story so all the surprises come from the direction rather than the plot. Would make great double with ""The Driver"" of which is seems a clear homage!",10
2012-04-20,"Absolutely loved the soundtrack, and didn't mind the lack of dialogue at all. This film seemed to speak to the introvert in me; characters were all very relatable. Didn't see the need for the plot twist; as that's not what the movie was about to me, but it didn't detract too much.",10

A movie you fucking love makes you use words like awesome, bad-ass, fuck yeah, and orgasmic when it's over. I'm pretty sure I actually said all of those words to my wife while the credits were rolling. The build up of tension in this film is done brilliantly by Refn. It's so thick you can feel it and when that tension is…",10
,Beautiful film. A master work of subtle nuance with a subdued performance by Ryan Gosling. It's tough arguing this one because anyone who says they didn't like it usually has a pretty well rounded well thought out reason why they did not. I think the slow pace and lack of dialogue really puts people off especially since this film is made in a way that modern audiences are not used to. Overall it was my favorite film of last year and I highly recommend it.,10

,If you can get into it you will enjoy it. From the opening scene it reminded me of GTA and as the movie progresses so does the idea that this is just a GTA mission on film... and if that sounds good to you then you will enjoy this great tribute to a NEO-1980's,8

Another film that defies expectations as it is an action film but it is a little bit more thoughtful than that. I am reminded of some of my favorite 80's thrillers like To Live and Die in L.A. and 52 Pickup when I watched this. Albert Brooks gives a great menacing performance as the mob boss along with Ron Perlman playing his brother. Ryan gosling nails the nameless ""driver"" role and is pitch perfect as a sort of anti-hero for the new age. I really liked everything about this movie.",10

,"In the hands of any McMovie director for hire Drive could have ended up all action but no substance but in the hands of director Nicholas Winding Refn, It's a slow-burn romantic fairy tale that suddenly turns dark and very violent. A classic tale of revenge, love and madness is given a refreshing polish and shine. Winding Refn is a master at developing suspense and menace, and every frame of this movie is dripping with both. Drive is one of the very best.",10
,"This movie got a metric ton of bad critique by my friends, but when i saw my idol and favorite film critic use these exact words ""An exceptionally cool thriller."" i was bound to see it and i was happy i got to see it on the big screen.

A thriller opener that draws straight from Michael Mann's ""Thief"", the story steers into 'Taxi Driver' territory as Gosling's Driver falls for Mulligan's Irene, a connection that inspires that spectacular moment in the elevator... All this and Albert Brooks too. My second favorite movie of 2011 after 'Attack the Block' - make of that what you will : )",10
2011-09-28,"Drive is a strange throwback B-movie which takes a violent world of heists and gang violence and wraps it up in 80s stylings and soundtrack. The brutality is sometimes shocking but underneath it has an incredible depth, softness and edginess.

,"More of an artistic film, than what I came to expect. Slow start, but slightly better later on.",5
,"Drive makes the very basic mistake of adding on plot elements to forgo having to do any actual development. The acting is unmentionable in its mediocrity, which goes hand in hand with the direction.

During the actual film, all I could find were actors taking part in a sub par story with snail like action and epically slow story telling. Maybe I was not their demographic. It seemed more middle america speed if I could take a guess. A waste of time for me, thank goodness for the fast forward button.

It's not a character study or a drama, there just isn't much dialogue in the film and none of the characters are particularly fleshed out. In fact, the trailer probably contains half of all the dialogue Ryan Gosling's character has and I recommend you…",9
,Outstanding. I still listen to the soundtrack.,9
,"I didn't know what to expect when I first sat in my seat at the cinema when I went to watch Drive. But I can tell you now, I was absolutely blown away. I was hooked immediately by the great soundtrack. When the first bit of violence is introduced, it's about half way into the film. But when it hits you, it strikes you like a tonne of bricks. It's shocking, but fascinating at the same time. It's a great film, but so difficult to describe. The only way to recommend Drive to somebody is to tell them to ""just watch it"".",8
2012-05-12,"Wow is what I say after seeing this film, but whereas The Avengers was like a 'WOW THAT WAS AWESOME!' excited statement, this was more of a 'wow' because the film is understated.

One of those movies you want to watch again once it's over, it helps that it's only 96 minutes.",9
2011-10-01,Good but its been waaayyy overhyped. More style than substance and it was just trying a little too hard to be cool. The synthy 80s music really suited the film. Some of the cityscape scenes with the music were very reminiscent of Blade Runner.,7

There were several scenes where Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan just stare at each other for minutes without any dialogue. The movie starts out kind of good, but then the next hour it kind of drags on before finally there is some brutal death scenes. ",2
2012-04-15,"Awkward, contrived (e.g. soundtrack), capitalising on two trendy leads without giving them anything of substance to really sink their teeth into. The over-the-top violence and gore is a welcome reprieve in this otherwise flat and over-stylised film.

The atmospherics created as a backdrop for deft character based performances, rather to set up violent set pieces. The energy of the film crackles just under the surface most of the time. The violence is tough and sudden in contrast with the ambient/techno/80s soundtrack. I wish I would have seen this in the theatre for which I think this movie was made.

,A stylish homage to action films of years past. Drive is an ultra-violent masterpiece that does cinematic masters such as Sam Peckinpah and Jean-Pierre Melville proud.,9

2012-03-20,Captivating performances with an awesome soundtrack... nuff said!,10
2012-06-01,My favorite parts of the movie was when he was driving. Very good cast. More violent than i thought. Good watch.,7
,So this is my first review on Letterboxd- and it's a negative one.,1
,The very opposite of what Hollywood teaches people to expect from a film like this. The build up and tension that precedes the moments of violence are beautifully filmed and matched with a great soundtrack.,9
2012-06-09,"Oh, THAT story agan… Well, alright, somwhat modified. Nevertheless, what's with that hype? Quite nice, though.",7
2012-06-10,Started watching not knowing what it was about or who was in it. Was very pleasantly surprised by Bryan Cranston and Ron Perlman. It's like mixing two of my favorite shows together. Oh joyous (Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy if you're TV illiterate :P) day. ,8
,I bloody love this film. It's pretty much perfect.,10

,my review at:moviemacrocosm.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/9-drive-2011/,9
2012-06-12,"Boy, that escalated quickly.",8
2012-06-16,"This was a pretty good film I've been putting off for a while. It seemed like a big budget indie movie, if that makes any sense. It was sort of jarring to have a bit of the old ultra-violence come out of nowhere, but it worked well to tell the story of the character.",6
2012-06-14,"I really liked the way the violence in Drive was timed. There just wasn't any for a long time, and then BAM! you're hit with a scene. Then it continues it's non-violent streak, relying more on curt replies than anything. And then another brief, but very intense, violent scene. This was continued until the end of the movie. It felt very different and almost raw.",8
2012-06-15,Incredible movie. Ryan Goslings acting is superb and Nicolas Winding Refn really shines through in this movie.,9
2012-06-17,"In less capable hands Drive could have been very ordinary. Instead Nicolas Winding Refn takes this story and gives it an exquisite dream-like quality. Stunning visuals, great casting and phenomenal soundtrack all come together to make a classic. I expect Drive to be spoken about for a long time.",10
,"More ""Taxi Driver"" than ""Fast & Furious"", this portrait of a getaway stunt driver trying to do the right thing is broody, smart and shocking --when the violence comes, it comes hard, bloody and out of nowhere. Gosling is amazing, Brooks is even better.--Más ""Taxi Driver"" que ""Rápido y Furioso"", este retrato de un conductor de Hollywood que además ayuda en robos es oscura, inteligente e impactante --cuando la violencia llega, llega duro, llena de sangre y de la nada. Gosling es genial, Brooks es aún mejor.",9
,The most stylish film made in years. Gosling's silent Driver says more without dialogue than is normally imaginable. It has a lot of elements and they all stitch together seamlessly to create what can only be described as something special. The music alone makes this film worthwhile and yet it has everything else still going for it - including one of the best casts ever.,10
,"Now this is a film that needs to be watched at a time when u are feeling relaxed and u don't want to kick the b'jesus out of anybody near by. Gosling is a cold hearted, cool son of a bitch and plays his character with a sharp and chilling realism. The plot is slightly contrived but no matter as the pace is fast and the violence can only be rated as ooooooooooooof on the oofometre. Treffic watch!",9
,"Now that this is on Netflix, I've found myself watching this near five times in the last week. This film has been receiving a whole lot of mixed reviews, so I thought I'd throw my hat into the ring. A great ensemble for a bunch of shallow characters. Great lighting and cinematography are accompanied by an exhilarating soundtrack. Ryan Gosling is... Ryan Gosling (and I love him for that). The film provides great action that fades into subtle drama and then takes a complete 180 in a realm of hyper violence... my kind of action film. Definitely worth a watch.",8
2012-06-16,"Drive is such an exact dissection of the action movie hero it's almost startling. The unnamed hero wears an absurd but iconic and metaphorical jacket, and can usually be seen chewing on a toothpick. He almost never speaks. He's easily the most intelligent and capable person in the film, but he appears to be emotionally underdeveloped (that's perhaps not so odd, considering what he does for a living). Modern synthesizers underscore his every emotion. It's like he walked straight out…",9
,I'd really like the 90 mind I wasted on this one back.,2
2012-06-20,Urgh I love this film.,10
,"Up there with my favourite films. It is stylish and the cinematography is incredible, so much said in so little words. Ryan Gosling is suave as hell! Great soundtrack as well.",10
,"I think I saw this movie back in the '80s when it was called Miami Vice. All that was missing was having ""In The Air Tonight"" on the soundtrack.",6
,Do you wanna see something? Seeing Drive in the cinema alone was an incredibly intense experience. Despite the unexpected closing scenes the film ultimately left me feeling good about life.,9
2012-06-21,Great script and soundtrack. Ryan Gosling really drives this one home.,9
2012-06-20,"Finally caught this one, very very good.",9
,"Not sure what all the fuss is about with this film. Some people speak about it as though it is a masterpiece. Its competent rather than outstanding. Overall totally overrated, $13 million spent trying to make it look like a $2 million indie.",5
,"I wouldn't watch it again, but it was good. It was surpisingly entertaining to see a woman's head explode by a bullet, and I'm interested in the next Winding-Refn/Gosling adventure.",6
,"Not at all what I expected, but I really was positively surprised! One of last years' best!",9
2012-06-26,"Brilliant in its simplicity, and proves that the less he speaks, the better an actor Ryan Gosling becomes.",8
2012-06-27,I was worried it wouldn't hold up on my second viewing but it's still pretty damn awesome.,9
2012-06-27,Loved the mood in this film. Visually stunning and at times extremely violent. Recommend it.,9
2012-06-24,This was a pretty intense movie. And a very different character for Ryan Gossling! It is nice to see he can be a versatile actor!,10
,"Easily my favorite movie of 2011. Was not what I expected it to be at all, but I ended up loving it anyway.",10
2012-06-24,"Despite my recent discovery, via The Ides of March, that Gosling's understated performance in Drive is less an acting choice and more his general state of being I still love this film. It's a case of a director picking an actor of limited range but one who perfectly embodies the part. It also has so much else going for it - great cinematography, a terrific retro score, Albert Brooks - that even if you remove Gosling from the equation it's still a magnificent piece of work.",10
,A perfect action movie. Excellent performances overall and dead perfect pacing.,10
2012-05-16,"Once I heard the buzz surrounding this movie, it quickly became a must see. I decided to read the book(which is rather short) before checking out the film, and for once having that background knowledge enhanced the film greatly. It is not for the faint of heart but the violence is done with such a finesse, and its a tour de force performance from Ryan Gosling. The author recently announced plans for a Drive 2 book, so one can only hope for another turn around the track in film as well.",10
,"I really don't understand what's cool and what's not. Case in point, that jacket. Personally I wouldn't be seen dead in something like that, but I've been told it's the epitome of cool.",8
,"well. I've seen it three times now. I read others' reviews of it and think, ""yeah, it's really artful...yeah...style....blah blah"". It's boring. I only watched it more than once because I was held hostage by co-workers who hadn't seen it. I feel so conflicted because I respect the film and think it really does have something special. However, I plead with all the gods above that I never have to watch it again.",3
2012-06-30,"It's probably fair to say that this is one of, if not THE best movie of 2011. Superbly acted by Gosling in the lead role and great direction from Nicolas Winding Refn. 'DRIVE is visually stunning and also has one of the coolest soundtracks in recent years. ",10
2011-10-03,Hands down my film of 2011. A modern classic.,10
2011-09-16,"The worst thing about Drive is the hideous, misuse of Mistral during the credits. You sit there, as Ryan Gosling drives into the night, wondering if you've been transported to a grittier version of Miami Vice. Maybe genre films remain an insular interest because the kitsch factor is too embedded in their culture? After all, this is the font that graced the intro of television's Night Court.",8
2012-06-23,Loved it. Looking forward to a re-watch soon.,8
,I know I am in the minority but I hated this movie. Had high hopes because the reviews were ridiculously good. This was ridiculously blah and just uninteresting and a waste of time.,2
2012-07-04,"Can see why this was top of a lot of critic 'best of 2011' lists, and also why not many people have seen it. Tense from the off, with amazing cinematography and a bubbling under current of feeling. Almost Kubrickian in the setup and style. Many will be put off by the fact that ""not a a lot actually happens"" and the almost wordless performance from Gosling, but hopefully will many more will soak up the atmosphere and enjoy this…",10
,"Not as good as everyone says. One of the most overrated films of last year but still quite expressive and impressive, just very sparingly. Gosling is average compared to Blue Valentine, and Carey Mulligan disappoints once more. Maybe I am missing something but the film as a whole had no emotional resonance and was not as enjoyable second time round. Visually nice in parts, just overall quite boring...",5
,"Stylish thriller that plays like Vanishing Point might if it were conceptualized by the bastard child of Sam Peckinpah and Michael Mann. Atmospheric and violent, with a Giorgio Moroder-ish soundtrack. First-rate, moody pulp.",8
2012-07-05,"Since I first saw this in the theater when it first came out, it still stands in my mind as one of the most surprising and unforgettable movie experiences I've had in not only a theater, but any film. Ever since the dvd first came out, I have seen this countless times but somehow, it still manages to be one of the best films I've ever seen everytime I see it.",10
,Fantastic. Great cinematography and love the retoro styled sound track,10
2012-03-25,"I love this film! I love the Soundtrack! I have a new love for Gosling (as does my wife for different reasons pointed out in Crazy, Stupid Love).I want his jacket but could never pull it off.",10

2012-07-07,Simply awesome,10
2012-06-26,"This film started off great. Very exciting and thrilling. But then it turned into a violent gory killfest. If I want to see that I will watch a Tarantino film. I wish it would have focused more on the getaway driver aspect, dodging cops, driving the city etc...",6
2011-09-27,"Cool as hell film, soundtrack one of the best have heard for years. Really reminded me of GTA Vice City.",8
2012-07-07,"Very impressed with Ryan Gosling in this role, he delivers a completely believable performance. Although it worked, some of the beauty and artistic flare niggled me. The quality is outstanding and I can foresee another viewing in the future.",6
2012-07-07,"The soundtrack is as good as everyone says! This movie is really tastefully shot and moves at a refreshingly unusual pace. This was originally going to be a blockbuster, but took a different direction when Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn took over. I'm glad he did, this movie infinitely more memorable than some throwaway blockbuster.",8
2012-07-07,A neon fever dream. Lots of staring and words never said interrupted by bouts of surreal violence and car porn.,10
,"If you're into blockbuster action movies, this isn't one. There's plenty of intense action, but this is a small film created by artists who love their craft. ",9
2012-07-08,"I feel like adding a quote, but this is not a very talkative movie. At least, the dialogue in it, is not what makes it so great. A very slow-paced movie, but with a great soundtrack, cinematography, acting. The whole deal. And the fact that it is (at most points) slow-paced, is one of it's great charms, in the same way that the carefully picked few words that are uttered throughout the movie, are placed just right. All I need…",10

2011-09-23,DRIVE is one of those hit or miss movies with a lot of people. You can really love it or hate it because of it's slow build and little dialogue in the beginning of the movie. For me I fell in love with it right away. The beginning car scene sucked me in. Nicolas Winding Refn (BRONSON) hands down is probably the best upcoming director of this era. The man knows how to tell a story and also has amazing…,9
,"Ryan Gosling just beat people to death most of the movie, the other half was spent not talking.",6
,"Sometimes a movie just gets it right. The images, the soundtrack, the swagger all just skip to a rhythm that seems at once modern and timeless. Drive was called ""cool"" and it's certainly that if not ice cold.",10
,Great movie. One thing about this movie is the soundtrack made the movie that much better,8

,"Ocassionally slow or weird, but strong atmosphere and visually beautiful movie.",7
,"Awesome film: beautiful cinematography, brilliant directing, great acting, awesome music. Really atmospheric, dramatic, shockingly violent in places, and exciting. Not the most original of plots, but it's executed so well that it still manages to be a brilliant film regardless.",10

Full of intricate details that enable this film to stand out, 'Drive' could well be one of the most well made and engrossing movies to have been produced. What really sets 'Drive' out from other similar films, is that it was released without much marketing and yet is so well produced that it is able to…",9

2012-07-09,"So much hype surronding Drive kinda ruined it for me, but after re-watching this film, it is a very well done film and you can see both cast and director have put a lot of heart and style in to it. The sound track gets you going and the opening scene keeps you on the edge of your seat!",7
,"This film, above all else, is an acquired taste. With constantly changing shifts in tone, the unpredictability of Gosling as ""The Driver"", and the extremities of the violent acts committed in the film, some viewers may find the film hard to take in all at once. But underneath the few, but brutal scenes of violence, and deliberately slow pacing, there exists one of the smartest, well-crafted crime stories of the year, and as a film it evokes all the subdued fury of Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers.",8
2012-01-14,"Quite simply, for me, the best film of 2011 by some margin.",10

,"Hard to remember the last time a film as cool as Drive was released, from its acting to its soundtrack everything about the film screams cool quality.

,Really overrated movie. Didn`t like it.,4
2012-07-14,"The thing I like most about Drive is the contrast of pacing that works incredibly well. Conversations between Ryan Gosling and his neighbor are subdued and languid, but in other scenes violence explodes in a sudden fury out of nowhere. This pacing mirrors the movie's genre combination of a subdued romance with a crime thriller.",8
2012-07-08,"A much-needed re-watch. I liked the film in theaters, but with a film as specific as Drive, there's always going to be some adjustment reconciling your expectation or idea of what the film will be like to what it is.

,"Slow burn thriller, not the 'hi-octane action thrill-ride' you may have been led to believe. Scandinavian director Refn proves that non-US film-making techniques don't always translate well to the big screen, but if you're patient enough with the many long, meaningful pauses, you'll find yourself sucked into this.",7

Ryan Gosling barely speaks and instead, just stares into the abyss whenever he can... I would forgive this if it were a long movie but it's only 1h40m and subsequently, the story is very sparse and trimmed. All in all, I would probably enjoy it if it were at least 50% longer.",6

2011-10-23,[AVC A] Fantastic. Great movie. Another movie where the soundtrack adds so much to the film. Gosling is perfect at playing that quiet role. Mulligan is adorable. Albert Brooks is so fun to watch playing this type of scary gangster. The direction of the film is so spot on. There isn’t much to discuss about the movie because it’s all just done so proficiently.,10

,The soundtrack is reminiscent of Risky Business. The rest of the movie however is not. Ryan doesn't fit the role of the jaded silent badass type. The whole story goes by at a crawl. I was hoping for something more like Vanishing Point with a title like Drive.,4
2012-08-05,"While a little slow paced, this film managed to engage me in a way that is hard to describe. Great performance by Ryan Gosling; he is able to convey a lot of emotion with barely any dialogue. All in all, quite an interesting piece of cinema.",8
,"This film hooks you and never lets go until the credits are over, giving you an emotional ride on the way. I honestly almost cried when I first watched it.",10
,"A great throwback to gangster films and Miami Vice. There was a time I felt it lost its charm in order to take a much darker road, which only hurt the film, but overall a powerful cinematic achievement and viewing experience.",7
,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I loved the directing, and the soundtrack, but everything else was lacking. Ryan Gosling continues to not really live up to his billing, the movie kind of drags along and then it ends, and it doesn't have the good sense to dull our minds with amazing driving scenes. The only thing it had going for it was its extreme violence, which didn't register as shocking so much as mundane.",4
,"Drive is a slick, cool, retro movie starring Ryan Gosling as an unnamed stunt driver, who also doubles as a getaway driver at night. It is not an action movie in the typical sense, and it isn’t filled with dialogue but instead grips you with it’s progressive build up, visual greatness and an epic soundtrack.",10
2012-08-09,"The whole thing starts with a no-nonsense intro that sucks you in, but then its like is never seen again in the movie. There is good acting to be found, but a lot of the scenes of character interaction are needlessly pensive. The 80s vibe really works though.

It’s not complex, it’s not new, but it’s simple and it makes sense and it keeps the show moving. I feel like…",8

The gore is so over the top, distracting, and unnecessary. The solemnity of the performances vanish every time Refn extends a scene into jarringly violent territory. Ryan Gosling is great and I really want to see more work from Refn for the most part but for right now I'm very disappointed in this movie.

The spartan dialogue serves almost entirely to propel the plot, and that’s fine, since virtually everything that makes Drive ridiculously satisfying comes from pure craftsmanship: the tense…",9
,"There's not much to say other than that this film is absolutely masterful. Gripping from start to finish and perfectly paced. Incredible performances from all involved, especially from Ryan Gosling as the ""Driver"" and his love interest. The first 40 or so minutes where they exchange glances, little smiles slowly curling across their lips as their eyes glimmer with love set to ambient music is incredible moving and makes the ultra-violent second half of the film all the more hard-hitting and powerful. Incredible, can't wait to see more from this director.",10

,"Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Drive"" is an expertly crafted 80's neon-noir throwback. His direction is electric, using different and odd techniques, which work so well for the film. The soundtrack is excellent, using it at key scenes, which perfectly fit. From the ultraviolent action, to Ryan Golsing's strong lead performance, Drive is a key piece of cinema that all aspiring filmmakers should see.",10

2012-08-16,"Drive is a film unlike any other, there is absolutely no film you could compare to it. That is what I think I love about it so much. Refn takes what was once meant to be a straight up cookie cutter action flick and turned the genre on its head in a similar fashion as when Seijun Suzuki opposed Nikkatsu studios.

Great soundtrack and performances, particularly Albert Brooks. If you love '70's cinema you will find much to appreciate.",9

,"Sad that, in this day and age, a well-made old-school crime thriller is considered groundbreaking, an instant classic. This is nothing more than a tightly plotted, well-acted and superbly directed genre flick. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But films like this were a dime a dozen in the 70s. Just think about that for a second. Sad, sad, sad.",8
,"There is so much to love about Drive, but probably the greatest joy of this film is that the rest of the world has caught up with the truly brilliant director Nicolas Winding Refn, who's filmography - from the Pusher Trilogy to Valhalla Rising to Bronson - has been one of the great treats of the twenty-first century.

,"Drive is a perfect genre film, a love letter to Charles Rane and Kowalski, the combustion engine, Michael Mann,Walter Hill and L.A.

This movie loves surface, from the poppy soundtrack to the scorpion jacket to the slick cars to the tangible charisma of Ryan Gosling. And that's okay, because ""all style, no substance"" is a valid academic criticism, but it doesn't make the film any less fun to watch. The artful direction really elevates this standard-issue material, and the central performance will be mentioned for years as a seminal point in a towering career.",8

2012-09-17,"Ryan Gosling’s almost mythological protagonist, Driver, is mostly seen behind the wheel in DRIVE, eerily calm and collected, save for the rare unleash of a latent monstrousness. In it, Nicolas Winding Refn offers an existential, exorbitantly romantic and violent road trip redolent of neo-noir urban thrillers decades ago. It tiptoes on the boundaries of pastiche, but intentionally so. As inundated as this year’s cinema has been with love letters to the cinema, this may well be also considered homage to filmmaking, if limited to the aforementioned genre.",7

,"Nicholas Winding Refn’s Drive is preoccupied with imagery. Everything about the film, from the Risky Business-esque font of the opening credits to the presence of Albert Brooks, consciously nods to the 1980s. Refn tries to create a particular “look” and he largely succeeds. The first 45 minutes of the film are icy, tense, and existential in a manner reminiscent of Michael Mann’s Thief and Walter Hill’s The Driver. However, the film’s preoccupation with imagery is one of the things that…",6

The opening getaway sequence alone is worth the price of admission, though it never quite reaches those heights again (I found myself wishing for a movie that was just a disconnected sequence of such scenes).

Ryan Gosling is especially captivating in the lead role as the mysterious, almost machine-like Driver, who's sparks of humanity are ignited once he meets his female neighbour and her young son.

Nicolas Winding Refn's excellent direction and the great performances by the cast make this a joy to watch, even if some of the joy is splattered all over the place in chunks of bloody viscera. Refn is certainly a director that keeps getting better and I'm looking forward to seeing more from him in years to come.",8

,"A film that received a considerable, and ultimately undeserved heap of critical praise for two reasons. First, it offers a sharp, colorful style. Second, it is utterly different from nearly all current films, particularly American films. Beyond those seemingly promising facts lies a self-important and ugly fetishization of violence and an ethos that offers a bare minimum beyond nihilism.",2

So I'll write some disjointed bits instead.Let me say first of all that I couldn't agree more with FilmApe with him saying that this is a samurai film. The character of The Driver occupies a very large part in the film and acts in a way opposite to what most people view as conforming to…",10
2012-12-04,Honestly this movie gets better and better every time I watch it. Gosling's amazing performance conveys so much emotion while barely saying anything. This must be like the 7th time I've watched it and it never gets old. I can't wait for Refn and Gosling to team up again.,10

Of course I remembered everything else that makes the film such a unique experience: The killer soundtrack, the unsettling lack of dialogue between Driver and Irene, Christina Hendricks being present, and Hank Scorpio. But yeah, I was shocked back into the moment by all the visceral gore on screen.",9
,"Pretty good action scenes, not a fan of the acting, story was pretty boring.",6
,What's not to like about this movie?Nothing. Everything I experienced was top notch. You slowly fall in love with Ryan Gosling's character and are truly sympathetic towards him.The soundtrack of this movie was incredible. The 80's inspired synths gave it a real blast from the past feel. It feels like this movie could have been set in any year over the past 30 years.I swear some of the music was inspired by or taken from Sunshine and Moon. I definitely heard a thirty second take on Welcome to Lunar Industries by Clint Mansell.,10

2012-12-24,"Unevenly-paced neon noir that packs a punch when things get moving. Ryan Gosling made considerable waves as the Driver, a prodigy on wheels who moonlights as getaway driver for criminals. As in most noirs, the hero gets into the worst trouble possible with the worst possible people for the best possible reasons... with not-so-good results. Albert Brooks also deserves some accolades as a surprisingly vicious bad guy. Modern music and great camerawork make this the best Michael Mann movie Michael Mann never made. Director Nicolas Winding Refn is apparently making The Equalizer movie, and Drive proves him a good match.",8
2012-12-22,"Why did it take so long for me to watch this movie? That was the question that plagued my mind when watching DRIVE. Ryan Gosling's acting was perfect, nerve-wrecking, that got under your skin... (can't really describe what he did there, just watching the movie can do justice to Gosling's work).",10
,Loved it.,9
2012-11-20,"A simple premise, with artistic execution. Good acting, led by a soft spokenly top notch performance from Ryan Gosling. Cinematography is awesome, the whole film feels like a neon sign, colors popping. The only other thing I need to really talk about is the soundtrack. Sets such an interesting vibe from this film.",8
2012-12-28,"A film that seduces slowly with a dense and silente narrative. The game with cameras in the second half of the film changes the tone. The soundtrack is special and worth every minute. The performance of the Driver, Ryan Gosling, deserves a worthy prize: he speaks with no dialogue, only with the eyes. And the direction of photography is awesome, very close to the dark, but the light of day arises breaking the sequence. A film to collection.",10

,"Recalling the genesis of the film, Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn spoke about his first disastrous meeting with actor Ryan Gosling. Who at the time, was interested in having him direct the still gestating movie 'Drive' - based on a book of the same name by James Sallis. Just prior to the meeting Refn had taken ill with a fever, in the hope of alleviating the symptoms, he ingested a sizable quantity of pain medication, leaving him in his own…",10

2012-11-08,"Drive is the type of movie that lulls you into a zone of quiet comfort before kicking you square in the teeth with relentless aggression. Rarely are movies this cool and never are people cooler than Ryan Gosling as The Driver. He can say more with the twitch of his eyes and the snarl of his lips than many actors can do with dialogue. This movie is as stylish as they come and features not one, but two heart-stopping bursts of violence, one of which is juxtaposed with a soft, beautiful moment that makes it all the more glorious. Best film of 2011",9
,A great slow paced gritty film that takes us into the mind of stuntman during the day & a wheelman for hire by night. With it's Los Angeles skyline as a back drop this film does not disappoint. Its John Hughes with violence.,10

The characters were also interesting. Still not something I will care to see again but not bad.",7
,"Tried to watch it twice, fell asleep both times. ",3
,"There was a time when action scenes were not animated on computers, film characters didn't talk like bad stand-up comedians, and violence in an action film could be more than a few shooting scenes now and then.

He works cause of great pictures, a fantastic soundtrack and last but not least strong actors, who need no long dialogues to further the story. The balance between, action, romantic, crime, violence and drama creates an incredible movie. Thanks Mr. Winding Refn!",9

,"Being one of those rare movies that garnered accolades from critics this year, Drive kept me waiting long enough. I must accept that the wait was not as rewarding as I had expected it to be. It concluded in a split in the middle opinion of the film. While I loved it for its detached nonchalance and sheer simplicity, I felt that the rom-action flick seemed rather amateurishly made at times.",7
,"I can think of no other film that I avoided for so long, despite being lead by one of my favourite male actors. 'Drive? Pfft. It's just another film about quick getaways with silly showdown scenes.' It kills me to think I passed the opportunity to see this at the cinema.

,Excellent and stylistic action/drama film. Sort of blows its load right at the start as the first scene in the film is without a doubt the best. Driver is a fantastic protagonist mostly due to Ryan Gosling's minimalistic and delayed dialogue and emotions. He feels bottled up and it shows.

,"What can I say, still standing as my favourite film, drive brings about something not that's seen not too much nowadays. A film that basically proves actions speak louder than words because the thing about goslings performance that makes it so brilliant is his character's behavior towards the fact that he is a recluse from most of society and has now (through the use of a very appropriate song) starting to feel like a human being.

,"Such an unexpected treat. The 80's. Mann inspired look and sound of the film is a joy to behold, as is the central performance from Gosling. The shocking violence later in the film is perhaps a little too much, but that is quite obviously the point. Watch the film, buy the soundtrack!",8
2013-04-13,"Drive will always confuse me. In 10 years time, it will be hailed as one of the most influential films of modern filmmaking (and suitably so). And beside the point of that lady trying to sue because it wasn't fast and it wasn't furious, it seems to be held in high regard by general audiences, besides the fact it's firmly in the art film stratosphere.",9

2013-04-13,"I watched this film a second time recently. I don't usually review films unless it is a first viewing but as my previous review was rather rambling and written in a state of both overawe and possibly in the haze of a hangover, it seems fair enough. On this viewing I was almost sober and so I have a much better idea of what I loved about the film so much the first time round. ",8

I love this film: it's smart, beautiful looking, restrained and insane in different moments. The performances are great: Gosling and Mulligan do a lot with a little (mostly glances, looks, and monosyllables), but Brooks, Cranston, and Perlman, with the more talkative roles, are absolutely fantastic. Brooks in particular is chilling, because c'mon, he's…",8

A minimalistic film that speaks in pop songs and flows smoothly as a dream that occasionally turns into a nightmare. The dialogue is so bare that the name of the main character doesn't even surface. I wasn't too sure of it at first, but a second screening made me love everything about this movie. Very glad the director didn't drop the film as he originally intended, because it is easily one of my favorites.",10

,"When I saw this film I didn't know what to expect - I didn't really care much about Gosling or know much of his work beyond Breaker High and Young Hercules (hehe), and I really overlooked any media attention this film received. Similar to ""Valhalla Rising"" (2009), another film by Refn, which had the unfortunate stigma of appearing as a typical straight-to-dvd about violent vikings, I expected ""Drive"" to present flashy chases and no depth.",9
2013-04-21,"Excellent! Very tense and exciting at appropriate moments, smoothly put together, but felt real, rather than just being movie action/crime/murder.",9
,"On second viewing this is no less entertaining. At times, Gosling's pause-and-look-pensive-for-6-seconds-before-answering-a-question stick gets a bit tiresome but on the whole this is super slick and wonderfully made. A sexy, glossy gem that was rightfully applauded",8

2013-04-22,"Loved it. Love love love love. It's so gorgeously shot and edited that I couldn't care less about the story, which wasn't that bad. But oh my dear dear lord how beautiful this movie is. Seems like most movies Ryan Gosling is in lately are all really good. Might have to give up my childhood hate for him (read: young hercules-trauma)",9
2013-04-23,Watched it again. Loved it again. Stunningly beautiful and gorgeous to look at.,8
2013-04-23,"Maybe the best thing about Drive is that Winding Refn isn't interested in deconstruction or subverting genre tropes, but instead implementing them for their maximum thematic and visceral impact - this puts him more in league with classic Hollywood filmmakers than his reputation probably suggests. But like Humphrey Bogart is supposed to have said, ""what's wrong with showing a guy getting his skull crushed by another guy's boots?"" ",10

There is crime, shooting, blood, violence, drama, those tarantinesque style twists...I liked it. A lot. The story is great. And the main character is weird in a way it reminded me of Taxi Driver.

2013-05-17,This brilliant film is like a breath of fresh air. It was the best film of 2011 and it gets better after several re watches. There is a mood set by Drive that few films can achieve these days. It stirs up more emotion and suspense with as little action and dialogue as possible. That's something most summer blockbusters can't achieve with all the explosions and car chases imaginable. Everything from the script to the performances to the music in…,10
,I don't think there's anything about this movie I don't like. Ryan Gosling is pretty much my favorite actor. The soundtrack in all it's eighties glory is oddly apropos.

Who would've thought a scene of Ryan Gosling staring at a door waiting for two guys to run out of it could be so tense?). The directing is…,10

This is a movie that's all about atmosphere; from its synthpop/electronic soundtrack to the brutal violence, to the simple fact that Ryan Gosling really doesn't say much throughout the entirety of the film. It's an interesting experience. I don't think its the greatest thing to ever grace my screen, but It is undoubtedly a must-see movie.",8

But the spare story and cast characters who all fall into one of two categories -- one note or blank slate -- provide a far-too-minimalist spine for the film, no matter how hard director Nicolas Winding Refn attempts to buff every frame into a hyper-stylized sheen. Also, Drive's most thrilling sequence, by a large margin, is the pre-title getaway. When your movie's best scene is its first, that's usually a problem.",6

The music score was well chosen and I adored the slow motion scenes which captivated the mood in contrast with the high speed car drives. Gozlings performance never faulted, playing such a complex character who could be so loving and yet so incredibly violent, I was convinced by his portrayal. such a good actor.

Carey Mulligan and Ryan Gosling are great and deliver fine preformences and fantastic well built characters (especially gosling, mulligan got a tad cliche). Bryan Cranston is also very good as well as rest of supporting cast. The film delivers home and is…",8
,"I love Nicholas winding refns earlier stuff especially the pusher series and venhella rising. This is his best film to date.

,"Before I start, let's all agree that the 80's was the best time for movies. It was a time of striking originality, fast-paced action, classic cheese, and overall, cool enjoyable films everyone can enjoy no matter how many times we see them. To any child raised by 80's culture such as myself, Drive is a must. Reminding me a bit of the old action movies from the 70's and 80's with those great old cars that could take one heck…",9
2013-06-12,I seriously don't understand how anyone can find this movie boring or slow.,10
2013-06-13,"A truly beautiful movie, Drive perfectly captures a great plot using superb acting, a perfect soundtrack, and some amazing shots. I loved the mood that this film set.",10
2013-06-13,I do not understand why everyone raves about this film. I really didn't think it was anything special whatsoever. #unpopularopinion,4
2013-06-14,"intense violence, slow building",9
,I should hate this movie but I don't. Its style puts you in a trance without looking like an acid trip. Its characters are boring and one dimensional but you cant help fall in love with Gosling's perfection in portraying a protagonist who can do no wrong. The music is sensational and really gives this the extra star rating.,8
,The autistic man likes to drive cars.,8
,"I loved watching this- and the more I think about it the more I like it. Probably my favorite film from the last few years. And not only is Ryan Gosling dreamy, but he's also awesome!",9
2013-06-20,"Still, the best opening 10 minutes of any recent film I can remember. Found myself liking the film a lot more this time, but being less impressed with Gosling.",8
,Slick and intense. It's definitely no action movie. It's more about the feelings and the tension.,9

,Very suprised for the amount of gore and the catchy music. This movie has that 80º mood and I'm a sucker for that decade so... just amazing,9

2013-01-03,"Not sure on the date. First ever real Ryan Gosling film I've seen. I was pretty much floored. Saw it a while ago but still very memorable. The romance is not in this reality, not fully depicted but yes fully felt. The juxtaposed believable, feather touch tenderness and absolute brutality left an impact on me. storyline, characters all bad ass, sort of make you curious about other possible lives, one of the cool powers of film.",8

2013-06-29,"I've already reviewed this here a couple of times, so not much else to say. I have not tired of it at all and I'm still amazed at how rich the Driver-Irene relationship is, considering they don't really have a tonne of dialogue together.",10

If I could name them all, it would be a list of less than ten.Carey Mulligan is still lovely, Ryan Gosling is still…",10

2013-07-08,"A brilliantly quiet movie that competes with The Muppets for my favorite film of 2011. (I have a very wide range of taste, don't I?)",10
,"Yeah, the inconsequential story is both paper-thin and shopworn, but Nicolas Winding Refn had me in his clutches from the very beginning of the virtuoso title sequence, and never let go. It's an exercise in style, but it delights at every turn. ",9

2013-07-10,"Art direction combined with some pretty good music is unlike anything I've ever seen before, it's a beauty. Carey Mulligan's natural charm and the Driver's shy persona aren't too bad either. Plot-wise, after the Driver gets mixed up with Standard's business... I didn't expect the Driver to just turn rogue for a married woman, but I guess love makes you do crazy things.",7
,"Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is what some one would call some kind of cult film, such as Fight Club or Reservoir Dogs. It has some of the same characters and some of the same unforgettable elements. But the problem is the plot, which isn't that original, but the way the whole movie is filmed, its graphic shock violence, heavenly cinematography, and its amazing soundtrack, makes it definitely a well crafted film, that are done right with real professionalism.",8
2013-07-10,"Movies such as “Faster” and “Drive Angry” featured well-known actors as furious and/or revenge-stricken men who are great behind the wheel. Unlike “Drive”, those films were neither great nor memorable. Directed by Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, “Drive” is a gritty and violent film that features an intense performance from Ryan Gosling. ",10
2013-07-10,"It is a rare ability for a film to both rely on a sense of nostalgia and simultaneously introduce something new that is its own. Drive, a neo-noir thriller from director Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Valhalla Rising), is a perfect example of one of those rare films. The story follows an enigmatic man who drives stunt cars for films by day, and moonlights as a getaway driver at night. The driver, who has no name, meets his neighbor and her…",10

,Probably the most mesmerizing and entertaining films of 2011.,10
2013-07-05,A great love story and action movie. Drive is one of the best movies of the 2000's by far and needs to be watched more than once to really experience the story and characters.,9
2013-07-19,I rewatched this film last for the first time since seeing it in theaters. The opening chase scene may be the best executed chase scene in cinema history; it is perfect.,10

,"Echoes of early Coens, Mann, Scorsese, etc. Derivative and morally bankrupt, yet simply dead cool and a pleasure to watch (and hear). Seethes nostalgia for '80s neo-noir and presents it in a layered package of sociopathic ""romance"" as interpreted by a total product of Hollywood — a quiet man who wants to be the movie hero, the empty vessel, The Driver — all detached cool & style and unafraid of brutal violence.",9

At one point in the middle of Drive, my friend turned to me (and prior to this she'd been drumming her knees, making involuntary ""oh!"" and ""whoa!""s, and bopping her head to the awesome soundtrack) and said, ""This is disgusting, but I think I'm turning into you with movies.""",9
2013-07-21,"The Year Of The Gosling peaked with this genre-defying retro-neo-noir, in which The World's Greatest Human Being Alive Right Now does very little apart from pootle about in a car and beat a few people up, but does it in such inimitable style and backed by such an achingly hip soundtrack that it's impossible to take your eyes off him. A genuinely iconic actor creating a genuinely iconic character isn't something that happens every day; be thankful you were alive to see it happen this time.",10
2012-03-04,"The singular vision that this film possesses is something I admire more than I enjoy. The directorial technique that Winding Refn employs to both display and examine violence alternates between smart and thrilling to lazy and graphically dumb. At times the themes and tones that the director emphasizes exist at the consequences of compelling character arcs. The cast is lights out, especially Cranston, Brooks, and Gosling.",7
2013-07-18,One of those I have wanted to see for so long even though it was on my Netflix instant queue forever. Finally got around to watching it and liked it so much. Very visual and engrossing.,8
,"I had seen this movie September of '11 on the big screen; I figured I needed to watch it again before I rate it here, as I really enjoyed a good amount of it but I also had some complaints which prevented me from loving this as many people do on the Internet.",8
2013-07-22,"Something happened between all the passion-filled long pauses and genuinely intense action-filled sequences and electronic music and stunning cinematography. What was it? Well it wasn't a whole lot, but Driver is easily the coolest character ever and I would totally run away with him so thanks a lot Ryan Gosling.",9
2013-07-22,"To keep it nice and simple on this review, Drive didn't work for me too well. Ryan Gosling is absolutely fantastic in the role of the unnamed driver but around him, there was a lot of quietness (which I understand is the director's attempt) but through this, I just felt that characters weren't necessarily fleshed out. I wasn't invested in most of the stuff the film had to offer but where the film truly saves a large deal of it…",5
,"Giving us a languid, gorgeous film which relies on minute facial tics and body language to convey the story, then suddenly splashes the screen with guts and gore, feels a cheap trick. The inner violence being unleashed is enough in and of itself. We understand. We don't need to be literally beat across the face with it.",9

2013-07-24,"Incredibly impressed with this movie. I wasn't sure what to expect when i started it but heard good things, and the elevator scene where he literally stomps a guys head in was probably one of my favorite movie scenes, the deaths were decently graphic for a non-horror as well. This movies also full of some pretty good quotes that Ryan Gosling says such as ""You shut your mouth, or ill kick your teeth down your throat and shut it for…",9
2013-07-22,"Simplistic almost to a fault. Yet it constructs everything through a nearly irritating subtlety. While it's a good movie, I honestly gotta say I found myself a little bored by the latter acts. It reminded me of The Powerpuff Girls movie. Slow buildup that turns into an orgy of violence. But unlike the PPG movie, Drive offers the viewer self reflection and questions about big whys and whats and how fars.",7

2013-07-25,"I hated Ryan Gosling's autistic ""stare into space quietly to convey thoughtfulness"" performance when I first saw this. But after just watching ""Only God Forgives,"" comparatively, his performance here is akin to Jim Carrey's in ""The Mask."" ",5

2013-07-26,I have taken some time off from letterboxd and was unsure when to return. My rematch of Drive has prompted me to return. This is my third viewing. It is a great film...but why?,10
,"The film Drive reminded me of most is Stephen Soderbergh's Out of Sight. Not because they have anything at all in common in terms of story or style, mood or look. They don't. But because they are adaptations of fairly strong crime novels - in this case, of James Sallis' pared-down, hypnotically taut getaway-Noir story - which are elevated somewhat by directors with a thrilling sense of the cinematic.Even then, elevated may not be quite the right word. Drive…",8
2013-07-27,Mixed feelings after watching this one. The opening sequence is freakin' superb: such a strong start. Our introduction to both Gosling's and Cranston's characters is done deftly. ,6
,A decent though overrated exercise in style and technique. A case of style over substance. 6.7/10,7
2013-07-28,"My recent viewing of Only God Forgives prompted me to watch Drive again. While different from a lot of major blockbusters and thrillers, it still has a hero who is easy to root for, car chases, heists, and plenty of bloody violence. I liked it at least as much the second time around, and it looks fantastic on blu-ray. ",8
2013-07-28,"Still the full package. Style, suspense, a fantastic soundtrack, fascinating cinematography, action, heart, atmosphere, a streamlined and satisfying story, rhythmically choreographed violence, and, yes, a lead character with rich emotional depth. It's there if you look for it, mostly in Gosling's eyes, which reveal the ocean of feeling beneath the cold exterior, and the barest hints of a past that is probably scarier than we'd like to know about.",10

2013-07-29,"I have not felt such suspense in a long time. His attitude was hard to read, but at the end of the movie, we definitely know him. Terribly, unspeakably sad.

A theme that speaks to a lot of the lonely people out there.",10
2013-07-28,"I never read the book, but I really liked this film for what it was. The camerawork and soundtrack were sublime. I felt there was a lot of emphasis on the violence/action. Don't get me wrong, those scenes were pretty darn strong but at some point I really hoped there would be more attention for the actual driving and I wanted the protagonist to actually compete in races, which was implied in the beginning of the film. I don't know…",8
2013-07-30,Gosling is at his best when he shuts up for the largest part of a film. Tremendous acting.,9
2012-02-27,"Drive is basically an arthouse action film. It has a sensibility and style completely unto itself while still paying proper homage to the films that have come before it. It’s like a postmodern Bullit heavily influenced by 80’s Michael Mann, Martin Scorsese and quite a large dash of Jean-Pierre Melville’s Le Samourai. Despite being set in the present, there is a very apparent retro 80’s feel to everything complete with its neon pink fonts, bright color pallets, and one of…",9

Perhaps slightly over the top with the graphic nature of its violence (although the violence isn't featured all to often), but enjoyable nonetheless. Some great driving scenes too.",7

,"A crime thriller that’s unoriginal as hell on paper, but is rendered completely original in execution thanks to the unique visuals and tonal style that Winding Refn employs, such as the frequent use of long takes and wide angles that can’t help but just suck you right into the frame.

The stripped down, archetypal 80's action film (which one of the characters was wont to produce) elements are part of wonderful homage to the genre.

2013-08-28,"Is it original? No, anyone who has been watching film for a long time was recognising the 1980's being pumped through a filter of Walter Hill within the first minute.

Though not perfect, there are some very remarkable things about it that make Drive an enjoyable watch.",8
,"After finally getting to see Drive and after hearing good things about it, all I can say is - everyone was right. This is an absolutely spectacular film, a blueprint for how every action film should be from now on, eschewing the all too familiar and predictable route of all action, no plot or substance Drive creates a wholly realistic world, then places the action elements within it. It is intense, gritty and at times horrendously violent. The violence is…",9

2012-07-04,"Visually sumptuous neo-noir that lacks the genre's trademark snappy repartee, and magnetic performances for that matter, replacing them with ill-fitting explosions of violence. Those moments are really unnecessary, as the film would still be tense as all hell in their absence.",5

Me, I’m one of those who absolutely loved this film, after only watching it for the first time back in January, I have no problem calling this…",10
2013-09-08,"This is a movie that everyone will like in some extend. I'm seeing this film after seeing Only god forgives and I'm actually recognising the same style in Drive. I've read some reviews here that says it's just the opposite or whatever, but I find the two protagonists very resembling. Quiet, deeply troubled, wanting to do what's right... ",8
,Really liked this film. Ryan Gosling is amazing in it and the camera shots are great,8

,"Another personal favourite, this film masterfully combines action, romance and surrealism. The cinematography and especially the contrast of colours is beautiful, and I would highly recommend it.",10
2013-09-11,I don't think the writer of this movie likes skulls because a couple of them get DESTROYED. I can see why people would say this movie is slow or boring but if you really just pay attention its very high intensity and very subtle which was great.

2013-09-15,"I watched this movie for the first time about a year ago. At this time, I wasn't big on movies, but I sat down to watch one every once in a while. I knew nothing about the film going into it. I wasn't really interested and thus didn't enjoy it. A year later, I realize how dumb I was as a movie watcher, because this film is epic. ",8
,"An incredibly hypnotic and noir style film, very Lynch-esque in it's delivery. Brilliantly directed by Refn and wonderfully acted by Gosling.",9

2013-09-21,"I absolutely ADORED the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan. The little quiet moments between them didn't feel empty. I find myself grinning away every time I see the both of them grinning at each other. Despite the Driver's quiet persona, his presence in the movie didn't feel monotonous or boring. I guess it made the things he do and/or say even more impactful.",10

2013-09-24,"There's something remarkable about Drive; it's hard to explain. I've seen it at least ten times, and each time I seem to appreciate it more. Gosling is at maximum coolness and still emotionally captivates an audience. He's an '80s action movie hero placed into a realistic modern world, and he gets into big trouble. Refn hits a lot of unstated emotional depths and at the same time tells an incredibly stylized and tense story. There are no negatives here.",10

,"80s inspired crime thriller, Ryan Gosling plays a stunt man who decides to help in a heist to protect his neighbour and her kid from ruthless gangsters, But when the heist goes wrong it turns into a fight to survive, Brutal action drama with nods to 80s classics such as Michael Manns Thief with a great soundtrack",8
,The soundtrack on this thing deserves its wow effect. Carey Mulligan continues on being extremely mesmerising and I think I have a new female crush now. Don't even get me started on Gosling and how brilliant he is.,8

Excellent directorial choices throughout, especially in the thrilling driving sequences. A bit less engaging for me in the final third, which felt like little more than tidying up which characters were living and dead. The minimalist approach to painting the characters' backgrounds and motivations further limited my empathetic response. Also, the scorpion motif didn't need to be spelled out quite so explicitly--we've seen The Crying Game. These quibbles aside, I'd still recommend Drive as an atypically meditative action flick.",8

,"It’s a simple story: a love story, a brutal story, a story with mystery and draw, a story that is masterfully executed in an intimate manner. Many people dislike it for its lack of “morals”, but film doesn’t have morals. People do. Like it was said in Holy Motors, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder”, the same can be said of the morals of movies versus the audience. So if you don’t like the film because it was…",10
2013-01-09,"Super late with this one. I think this one turned me off because it looked super dull and had stupid Ryan Gosling in. Can’t remember a film with him that was good. But seriously, a film with Bryan Cranston, Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, Christina Hendricks, Ron Perlman, etc couldn’t really stop me watching it for that long!",10
,"Nice character-driven film. Thriller with romantic sub-plot that really worked - some great acting, nicely played.",9
2011-08-19,Beautiful cinematography and a kick ass soundtrack that I still listen to today. I appreciated Gosling's mysterious guy with no-name who you know has a volcano bubbling underneath. I enjoyed the simpleness of the relationship with Mulligan and the cast of characters were mostly interesting. Director & DP definitely presented an interesting view of LA like I've never seen it.,8

2011-09-25,"Drive works well as an extremely economical neo-noir - there's probably 6 pages of dialogue in the whole film - but it is the quality of the filmmaking which really impresses: the cinematography is superb, the symbolism of the framing exquisite, the lighting and sound design all contribute to get us into this character's story. The style creates the substance of this film.",9
2013-11-01,This could be a remake of a million different Korean movies where the protagonist just stands there doing nothing interesting at all until the director needs an intense moment of violence to reconnect with the audiences senses in some way. But it's as stylish as it is empty and sometimes that's what I'm in the mood for.,6
2011-09-18,"As of late, it seemed that the same old car heist genre was going to gasp and sputter its way to redundancy and death. For the past decade, the genre has undoubtedly been successful from a financial standpoint, but from an aesthetic and narrative perspective, they all look the same: The hot rod cars, the death defying chases, the drop dead gorgeous gals, and the protagonist with nothing to lose. From a visual standpoint, it is characterized by chaotic editing…",10

2013-11-14,"The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. Then again, when you're watching a movie with people like my parents going ""What? What's going on? This is boring! Ryan Gosling is ugly!"", that tends to color your memory of it. ",8
,"The first half is a well made, almost sweet romance film.",10
,"While featuring an excellent performance by Ryan Gosling, great cinematography/direction and a memorable soundtrack, Drive is ultimately let down by a forgettable supporting cast and an unnecessarily ultra-violent story.",6
,"Filled to the brim with exhilarating cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack. Nicolas W. Refn's ""Drive"" is a phenomenal neo noir piece of ""movie-art"" which manages to flip from romance to sheer brutality seamlessly, leaving the viewer in doubt if it's still the same movie they began watching.",10
,"Acting, story line, symbolism, hell even the Child Actor does well.",9
,"I absolutely love this film all the way through. It's got strong performances, there's little dialogue but it's effective and the performances work with the long silent pauses, the soundtrack's incredible, I love the symbolism and hiding meaning especially behind the scorpion on the jacket, the directing's flawless and the violence brutal.",10

2013-06-01,"Really like this one, it has a great mood/tone/feel to it. The director and cinematographer did a fantastic job compromising the shots to have meaning. and i believe it had two different levels to it that made it better for me. The first layer being just the acting and the story, i found the acting to be great and the story was fun to see unfold and it was all enjoyable. But upon rewatching it i found it had lots of depth, the symbolism was really great and it helped boost the story. Also the soundtrack is amazing.",9
2013-11-30,"Just a great movie, all around. Not a dull moment for the entire runtime. Very, very pleased with this one, lives up to the hype completely. I'd like to watch this again and again.

Liked the gory/shortlived killing sequences. Just the right about of rawness.Reminded of No Country For Old Men, which I love, the minimal, bleak landscape, night and day suspense and straight up ruthless killing/street violence/gangster vibe.

,"Boasting a retro feel, catchy synth-pop soundtrack, New Wave credit stylings, and Lynchian bursts of graphic violence, Nicholas Winding Refn’s Drive basically attempts to be a high-minded, crazysexycool throwback to the Cinemax thrillers of yesteryear. (Put simply, what The American was to the European arthouse, this film — despite its nods to 70′s flicks like Vanishing Point and Two-Lane Blacktop — is to 80′s trash.) In this regard, Drive is half-successful: It’s well-made, stylish, and often-entertaining trash for sure. At…",4

,"Everything about this film is amazing!!! The chemistry between the characters, the music, the plot, the cast...it was just amazing.",10
,"The car, and more specifically, the act of driving is one of the most resonant existential metaphors in pop culture. People often make the mistake of thinking driving is about speed, but it isn’t, not really. Driving is about control, about being able to guide yourself, to escape from the things that seek to exert control over you, about the possibility of giving up that control to someone you trust. The act of driving is an extension of the driver,…",10

2013-12-23,"It has a certain nerve, but not enough to justify the slow pace.",6
2013-12-22,Watching the film again has really made me just love the film even more. It's visual style is incredible without being overbearing. Plus the complexity it gives characters in what is in essence a simple plot is what I love the most. Knowing the power a simple look can say more than the longest dialogue scene. It makes me want to go back out and make my next film. I can't give higher praise to a film than saying it inspires me to make more myself.,10

,"Where to start? I decided to give this movie a shot because everybody who's seen it has spoken really highly of it, and I have to say I was totally blown away. I thought the scorpion metaphor was clever and the dialogue (or lack of dialogue) was very well done. The cast was the perfect amalgamation of actors I'd never expect to see together and all delivered excellent performances. I'm also not very familiar with Refn's work but would like to explore his films more in the future. I absolutely loved Drive and look forward to seeing it again.",8

The reason for this is that as hard as I have tried I am unable to disassociate it from a period of my life, a pretty great period of my life - For that reason I worry that I see the film through some sort of rose tinted glasses. Hearing songs from its soundtrack sends me back to those days and the wonderful nostalgia that it…",8

Great performances, great direction and cinematography, wonderful use of music. Fairly straightforward story. It's the tone of the movie above all else that makes it work so well. ",9
2014-01-04,"This is an interesting one because there was a lot of hype around this film and this was one of the main reasons I chose to watch this. However I felt that it is trying too hard to be a niche film with all the slow, sometimes non-existent, dialogue and the long takes. However Ryan Gosling puts in a good performance as always and the film is surprisingly gory which I never expected. The cinematography is really good and I love the soundtrack.",8

The cinematography, gorey deaths, and amazing chemistry between the leads make it the cult-classic it so completely deserves to be. Intense car chases, blood, guts, pulpy subject matter, and a beautiful romance thrown into the mix make Drive a treat to watch. Seemingly, the combination it proposes couldn't work but it does. You'd have to watch it to understand why.",10
,"If I had to sum up this film in one word: style. I don't think I've ever seen film with such style, and a unique one at that. I find it almost humorous how the film intentionally avoids being a typical car action movie, as you can notice in the opening scene. The 80's retro music is incredibly catchy and I listen to it quite often. If you've never driven to the music of Drive, you'll feel like Driver and…",10

Although she is mainly in the background, her character is integral to the emotional development of Gosling's character.This is up there with Pulp Fiction…",10

2013-08-03,This is far and away my favourite Nicolas Winding Refn film. It takes the best elements of Refn's previous films and combines them with a bizarre new retro-synth soundtrack that produces some weird kind of alchemy. The upshot is that Drive subverts the 'action hero' trope with an ambiguously creepy/sweet romance and lashings of intense violence. All the while the film is utterly beautiful to watch and the simple plot is gripping and effective.,10
2014-02-21,"Drive is an exercise in style over substance, with blank characters lost in overlong stares and silences, dropped into a narrative that seems like an afterthought.

,"Brutal film. Pretty mesmerizing, as well. 'Drive' has a simplicity that is rarely found in films these days. There is also a sort of quiet about it, too...maybe due to the fact that the titular character has such limited dialog.

There are actually a lot of things wrong with the movie, but mostly it was a tired plot line (think any Jason Statham movie) without the violence.

2014-05-29,"This is my 15th viewing of Drive. That isn't an exaggeration, I have literally seen the film 15 times now. I didn't even attempt to catch it theatrically because honestly, I didn't know anything about it and I incorrectly assumed that it would be a film focused on car racing, like the horrendous misfire Need for Speed that was released earlier this year. If the main draw for a film is how cool a car is or how fast it…",10

It instills us with the motivation to tackle life's basic challenges every day but it also fills us with meaning and purpose for everything we do. Love greed, anger, violence, all of these emotions and actions are fueled by it. Drive is a film about that passion. It's about both the dignified quiet beauty in silent moments alone staring into the eyes of the person you love, and the abject brutality…",10
,"I don't get why this film is so beloved. It's nicely shot, and the acting is fine - but the lack of story and my lack of love for cars left me bored quite frankly. It feels a bit like an emperor's new clothes type of film. All hype, no content.",5
2014-06-05,I honestly wonder the film would have been like with a different score because it sets the mood perfectly in this film. The soundtrack also feels very much LA does from my brief visit.

I wasn't wild about Ryan Gosling's ""acting is (eventually) reacting (maybe)"" theory, but based on how the rest of the movie is, that could have been a director's call. There was so much stillness that I had to check the lil timer on the DVD player to make sure it was still playing (which has been an issue in the past with this player).It wasn't what I was expecting, especially with how polarized the opinions on it seem to be.

Kavinsky's Nightcall and College's Real Hero, among other tracks on the OST, were severely missed.

In fact I left humming songs from the original. For future rescorings they should do costume dramas or something crazy like that, see if they can inject some life into them, sort of like Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette.",9

The camera work is brilliant - Ryan Gosling is a brooding menace, swinging from perceived casual indifference to hyper-violent. Does he know where this is going? Does he care?

Refn isn't necessarily consistent with his films, but that's the point, all of his films feel drastically different. This film has become extremely influential as well.

Although I still think its status is a bit overblown, I have to apologize to Drive for my misplaced, pretentious grudge. ",8

With the American muscle car being an important part to the way you deliver a movie it's like you have a certain pedestal to live up to. What Nicholas Winding Refn does here is provides nostalgia to the highest degree when it comes to the classic cars and hardcore violence blended. What can I say?

The score is extremely evocative and the neo-noir elements gel perfectly with the world portrayed, but I felt that Mann's Thief tracked a lot of the same themes in a deeper and more substantial way. Themes of violence hiding just below the surface and inevitability are well developed and performances are good. Gosling's Driver is an enigmatic character who speaks only when he needs to and represents dangerous and heightened masculinity.",7

When I see this movie, I see a property that could have easily been mistreated by any other filmmaker. Nicolas Winding Refn has a style about him.

2020-12-16,"Drive, in my opinion, is one of the most impressive action films ever made. This film has it all: car chase, beatdown, brawls, etc... with a dramatic plot. Not all action movies are the same; not all have an exciting tone. Drive is somber, dark and somewhere soothing if you think of it. So, don't be mistaken if someone says it isn't action. It definitely IS, just without the escapist tone and blockbuster feel. It's how a real, grounded actioner would feel. If someone still disagrees, they don't get the action genre at all.",8
2019-05-05,"8/10I don't have much to say on this one. It's cool, stylish, and pretty entertaining, but, for me, it's also a bit underwhelming. What it does well, it really does well. It creates a hyper-stylized cityscape saturated in darkness and filled with violence, putting a violent hero in the center of it. A lot of the sequences are really powerful because of the film's stylistic flourishes (the use of violence, slow motion, color, etc.), but ultimately, the film as…",8

2024-05-04,"Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive is much less about being a stereotypical 80s crime action thriller and more about the atmospheric exploration of existentialism and morality through the mind of a sociopath wanting something more out of life.

2019-09-09,"One of the first films that made a true impression on me. It’s quiet, deliberate and beautifully shot. The story itself is very basic, and the lead is relatable despite being very quiet and understated. This is a thriller with a tragic, emotional core which thrives off of its clean 80’s pop-influenced soundtrack. Sprinkled with outbursts of extreme brutality to top-off the subtle moments with raw adrenaline. ",10

2023-08-29,"Ladies and gentlemen, I pronounce to you Ryan Gosling, a man of very few words. I loved drive so much this film has to be one of my favourite films I’ve watched this month and maybe even this year it was so good. From start to finish I was hooked. This film had such a great storyline and I thought it was very fast paced. The soundtrack aswell, my word, every song was amazing and fitted so well with the scene honestly there’s not a lot wrong about this film, you could really called this a cinematic masterpiece, well I will anyways. It was awesome.",10
2023-05-21,"Drive addresses the representation of the broken and purposeless male mentality, here Ryan Gosling's character is a lonely man, without ambitions and without a future perspective, he is a man without a purpose in life, it is clearly visible that this lack of purpose bothers the character a lot, because he is wandering through his life without a purpose, so much so that when he notices a beautiful girl, he quickly becomes attracted to her and sympathizes with her son,…",8

2022-05-06,"I wanna go straight from this to ""Extraction"" to be wowed again by how freakin tight and versatile Newton Thomas Sigel is as a DP. Any film that can paint a world so luminous and hallucinogenic and dip it in flat, banal threat is riding the right bus as far as I'm concerned.

He brings this feel to his films that I can’t quite put into words, but no other director can scratch the specific itch that his films provide for me. I fucking loved this.

My two favorite styles of film, as my good friends know, are gritty neo-noirs (like Nightcrawler or Blade Runner) and movies that subtly convey developing relationships (like Columbus or In the Mood for Love).

2020-04-05,"I’ve been putting this movie off for a bit because everyone I know loves it and it lived up to my expectations.

2022-05-24,The most collected character in cinema history. A guy so smooth he's probably never even gotten his shirt stuck on a door handle. If this makes me a filmbro then so be it because I'm in love with Drive and everything about it. The 1st 15/20 minutes are sooo stupid good.,10

Tense, thrilling, god tier cinematography, amazing score (not just the catchy pop songs, the actual score is great). The best movie to have a great soundtrack and an awkward main character who can drive real good (sorry Baby Driver, I still love you too) and the best Ryan Gosling movie where he doesn’t speak all that much (sorry Blade Runner 2049, I still love you too).",10

But inspite of its romanticism, it’s also a certifiably ugly and violent piece of genre fare, especially towards its closing act. ",10

Rarely I saw a movie with such little conversation, which nonetheless is telling so much by the glances and gestures of the characters. This requires a strong actors ensemble and by listing names like Gosling, Mullingham, Cranston and Perlman it is certainly given here.The storyline doesn't tell anything very inventive but the brilliant camerawork underlines this very stylish, calm and suspending thriller. In contrast to the grey Chevi Impala, the film definitely stants out of the bulk of modern action thrillers.",9
2020-08-29,"The graphic violence (not for shock value, it is necessary for the character and the themes and how events slowly unravel) the striking imagery, music and cinematography sum up to a modern masterpiece by Winding Refn. To me, Drive is something. Maybe it's because the film brought me to an era and a high feeling of nostalgia I've never experienced before. It's a time I never grew up in and a life I would never engage in but I felt something for Driver and his love interest. There's a lingering sense and feeling of intimacy, love, friendship and redemption. A bittersweet picture.",8

2020-02-25,"I really loved this film when it first came out. I loved the shallowness of it. The fact that Gosling and Mulligan were just pretty faces with no interiority. I loved its ostentatiously simple-minded synth score. I loved its meaningless violence, especially that scene in the elevator. I generally like movies that foreground their two-dimensionality because they seem wiser reflections of the human condition than middlebrow cinema that aims for what it assumes to be realistic depictions of three-dimensionality.

2019-12-30,Drive is a powerful and subtle film that carries its emotions throughout glances and showing rather than telling and show this film does. Drive is a masterfully shot neon soaked beauty where minimal sometimes clunky dialogue reins supreme. It is slow and quiet with violent outbursts flaming up in a few short moments. The film has some fully fleshed out arcs and a beautiful romance emphasized by an excellent and very fitting theme song. I originally watched the film over…,7

,"Quickie Review If there's ever a movie that made 80s style in pop culture cool again, not to mention a resurgence in neo-noir, it's Nicholas Winding Refn's modern crime classic. While there are great moments of violent action, the film's greatest strength is the cast, their characters, the cinematography, the music, the story and the directing. Not since ""The Driver"" or ""Thief"" has there been a satisfying ride quite like this.",10
2016-06-22,"Calling a film a masterpiece is no little task. You have to take many things into consideration, such as acting, score, cinematography, editing, sound, as well as direction. You can mull around all of these in your head for a while, dissecting every single part of the film, guaranteeing that you have a masterpiece. When it comes to Drive, it's apparent that you don't need to think about these things at all. ",10

2020-02-04,"It garners an excited audience ready to see some car chases and crazy getaways, but I find myself watching a rather silent movie, one in which characters only say things when they have to be said.

2012-01-11,"Though set in the present day, DRIVE has in several preeminent ways a feel not unlike the noirish elements of Chandler and Ross Macdonald, though more emphatically violent than those writers tended to be.

2023-02-25,This movie fucking sucks. Oh look at me brooding protagonist doesn’t talk and has a toothpick in his mouth because he thinks he so cool. KILL YOURSELF! stupid movie this idiot spent the entire movie trying to bag a 4/10 with a dumbass fucking kid. This stupid toothpick sucking cunt fought tooth and nail so he could pay child support for another man’s kid for the rest of his miserable existence as a bottom-dwelling scum. CUCK. There are government agents inside my walls I need to tear them down GET OUT OF MY HEAD. I know league of legends players with more rizz than this fucker.,1
2023-02-24,theres so much i want to say about this film but i truly have no words. it was just brilliant. this opening sequence is honestly one of my favourites Ever (it wouldve been a five stars movie if only there were more scenes like that one),9

2023-01-11,"One of the best slow-burn thrillers of the 2010s, and I always forget how amazing the cast was — flawlessly populated by great actors who I didn’t even recognize in Drive because of their grimy embodiment of each part. Every time I even consider watching another Nicolas Winding Refn movie, I can’t stop myself from just reaching for this instead (still haven’t seen any other).",9

2023-08-05,"Hate being in the incredibly vast minority here, but I must admit that Drive was such a huge disappointment in my eyes, which is a pity given the fact that I’ve been looking forward to give this one a watch for quite some time and I hoped if not love it, at least find it interesting and compelling for the most part, given its huge fandom (outside from the sigma male community, of course) and all the praise it has…",4
2023-07-26,"I was honestly expecting waaaaaaay more after everything I have heard about this. I mean it was fine but that's about it, nothing extraordinary but nothing bad at all either. I was really torn between giving it 3 or 3.5 stars because it is a well made movie but the plot felt kind of meh and I got a bit bored. I know a lot of people adore this movie but it didn't really do it for me today and as much as it hurts me (because im seeing Barbie tomorrow yayaayayyy💅) I have to give this 3 stars...😔",6
2023-07-25,"This movie is just such a fucking meme at this point that it's hard for me to take it with full seriousness, that's not a knock on the film at all it's just so incredible that it has had such a strange relevance and staying power even now 12 years later.",9

2022-07-24,"I don’t know what took me so long to watch this film, it’s amazing!The first half of the film had me like “why is this film an 18? There’s nothing bad about it, should be a 15 at most” and then the second half of the film came in and HOLY SHIT!!! The Driver absolutely is not literally me as I wouldn’t be stomping someone’s skull to mush 😆",9
2022-04-07,"'Drive' is a visceral and brilliantly executed vision of art-house action; possibly one of the greatest art-house films to have graced the screen. Nicolas Winding Refn has created a stylised neo-noir thriller that is simply stunning; full of glorified violence and stroking imagery. The soundtrack is amazing, fully reflecting the films mood, whilst attempting to create an atmospheric feel to accompany the gritty action. 'Drive' is a captivating mix of contemporary and retro aesthetics. A stylish and taut thriller that…",7
2021-10-17,"Unbelievably close to flawless, ever since i saw this for the first time earlier this year i’ve been dying to watch it again and for whatever reason tonight was the night.

2020-11-08,"And Noirvember continues...Driver is such a fantastic film! Ryan Gosling gives one of his best performances to date, he’s very subtle and a lot of the acting is Gosling’s facial expressions and body language. It’s really impressive! Nicolas Winding Refn does an INCREDIBLE job directing this film. It’s very slow and meticulously crafted, and in doing so shows us a way better examination of this man compared to how it would be portrayed in another director’s hands.",9
2020-07-29,“Can I talk to you? I won't keep you long. I have to go somewhere and I don't think I can come back. But I just wanted you to know getting to be around you and Benicio was the best thing that ever happened to me.”,10
2020-06-09,"drive is such a stylish, atmospheric movie. i love how calm and subdued it is most of the time, even as the tension ratchets up in the second half - it makes the outbursts of action or violence hit harder. ryan gosling does such a good job of getting you emotionally invested in the driver even though he's silent and brooding most of the time (goddamn he's a beautiful, fashionable boy). ",8
,"I like this movie, I really do....but, after giving it another rewatch I'm having a hard time coming up with any words for it. Maybe they've already been said. Maybe in the near decade since it's release, people have taken the best elements of this film, and made them feel so commonplace, that watching it now takes some of the neon out of the sign, leaving it blinking the word ""D_ive"", and making that electronic hissing sound.  I enjoy all…",6

A watch strapped to the steering…",7

2020-01-27,"Took me a while, but my god, I loved this film. Personally, the lack of backstory to The Driver makes his character even more compelling. The film is shot beautifully with the backdrop of LA, the score is aesthetic, and the direction is brilliant, with the script handling a romance with a revenge/crime story seamlessly. My only real flaw is that some of the side characters seem a bit one-dimensional.",8
2019-12-29,"Yeah well. Awesome writing, brilliant visual storytelling, fantastic acting, amazing soundtrack, incredibly intense and beautifully made...",9
2019-12-11,"Still a perfect movie. From the very first pop of the iconic soundtrack over the lurid pink text over the L.A. city scape to the extreme violence to the wonderful acting of Albert Brooks and everyone involved, it still works one hundred percent. It is not ""style over substance"", its just hella styled like no other and complete visual storytelling. If not in the top 10 or 20 of the decade, its close. But its certainly still the coolest.",10

2020-11-04,"i love NWR, but this is sadly still one of his worst films on the rewatch. bottom 3 for sure. far and away his most soulless and maniacally droll film. compared to the entire Pusher Trilogy (which in total were all made for less than half of Drive's budget), it's just docile, bland and un-engaging. i wish i stanned as hard as you do, but it's so apparent NWR hadn't tamed the tonal shift he would make in transitioning from his 90s/00s Danish work to the Hollywood mainstream (which i believe he finally reached an apex at in Too Old to Die Young).",6

2022-12-22,"The more I see this movie, the more I like it.  Ryan Gosling plays a stunt driver who supplements his income by being an incredibly apt getaway driver for hire.  He has little to say and does his talking behind the wheel.  Things get complicated and dangerous when he decides to help a family by doing a job with the recently released from prison, Oscar Isaac.  Great cast and beautifully shot film also stars Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston , Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman.  Nicolas Winding Refn directs.",8
,"I haven't seen Drive since it first came out, and I really fell under its spell at the time. But I was a younger, angrier man then, with a more romantic feeling towards aggression, nihilism, and the desire to be strong, silent, and self-controlled. Needless to say, I wanted to get the jacket he wears, but felt (probably rightly) I would look ridiculous wearing it. Now it's 11 years later, the world has changed, my life has changed, and so…",6

I dig this movie's style but I felt like some of the sequences with music are a little bloated and kind of feel like pointless little music videos. Additionally the portagonist's silent badass shtick can sometimes lead to awkward exchanges, especially with his love interest. Overall though it was very good and I will definitely watch it again.",8
2020-07-03,Sometimes it's a struggle to talk about films you love because it comes across as hyperbolic gushing. It seems hard to be fair or recognize moments that aren't so great. Drive came out at the right time for me when I realized just how art can affect people like really affect people. It sounds corny but Drive may have been the first film that I welled up because of aesthetics alone. The whole film casts a hypnotic spell over me I find it hard to look beyond the hyper-stylized visuals but I do find this minimalist love story every bit as engaging as that first viewing.,10
2020-06-30,The vibe that Drive exudes is always able to transport me to those late night drives in the car with the people I love. The windows are down and the radio’s on but no ones listening.

2022-06-21,"An infinitely intoxicating brew of scuzzy 80s grime crime aesthetics, modern action spectacle, and aching unspoken romance. Refn’s mise en scene is almost embarrassingly perfect for every frame of this meticulous masterwork. Gosling, Brooks, Isaac, Mulligan, Pearlman, Cranston and Hendricks; a loaded cast that massively outperforms what this script could’ve been. No performance drags and no moment lacks gravity or authenticity, even in moments of slow silence. Drive is just a perfect storm of filmic perfection with surface level accessibility to go along with its technical and thematic brilliance (and holy shit the Second Sight 4k looks incredible).",10

2021-06-21,"Nifty little thriller—modest goals and compelling execution. Gosling says that his character’s problem is that he’s seen too many movies, and while that’s clearly the case, it’s not an attitude the film ever really challenges, because Refn has also seen too many movies. Drive’s world is a wholly cinematic one, a smoothly glamorous construction into which reality never intrudes; even the violence is stylish. Contrary to the common assertion that this is gritty and grungy, it’s all seduction and surface—so basically superficial, at least emotionally, but so slickly executed that you don’t care. Very entertaining. And I appreciate the superb contribution to the ongoing Kenneth Anger jackets cause.",8

There is just so much to praise and applaud in Drive but above everything else, one detail made this film disparately bolder and brilliant after I delved right into it after seeing this which is Refn's immersing use of a symbol that significantly accentuated the entirety of Drive[r]'s nature. This involves the elements and the fable comprising the scorpion symbol.",9
2020-07-16,This was such a let down. The beginning of the film wasted so much time trying to look cool or create this aesthetic without establishing a strong story line/first act.

2020-07-28,An L.A. Synth-Rock FableBeen on a synth-pop kick lately so I thought I’d rewatch the film that revived the genre. Fairly certain there are more synth artists now than there were in the actual 1980’s.,8
2020-07-13,"This might seriously be my favorite performance of Ryan Gosling. What he manages to pull off in the second and third act of this movie really got me by surprise. Speaking of the movie itself, it's brutal, emotional and raw, full of some of the best intense sequences I've seen recently that got my heart beating way too fast. Wasn't expecting to love this movie that much, but lord, didn't I absolutely fell in love with it. Also, that soundtrack was chef's kiss.",10
2020-05-26,"It’s slick and shiny, Ryan Gosling oozes cool, and there’s some wonderful performances from Bryan Cranston, Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, and Ron Perlman in here.",9

2020-04-11,"What an amazing film this is. The story is very engaging, the direction is great, the musical score is amazing, the cinematography is beautiful, the action sequences are intense and very appealing to watch, and the performances were all spot on especially from Ryan Gosling. His performance is like Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver or even Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler. That kind of acting where the person doesn't say much and moves around like a robot. However, Gosling's performance…",10

2020-03-16,ryan gosling DOES in fact have what one would call the range,9
2020-02-14,"Drive is the first action movie I've ever seen that despises violence. Every fight scene that takes place in this film is a tragedy and never a triumph, every gun and knife is viewed as the perpetrator of death and loss that it is. The flares of violence are sometimes the most somber and soft-spoken parts of the film, whispering a plea for the horrors to end that can only be heard through the camera's lens.",6
2019-11-21,"I did like this movie, but not as much as everyone else I guess. I thought it was solid, I kind of wanted to wear the jacket Ryan Gosling had on and I inevitably used toothpicks a few times after I saw the movie, but beyond a fun action movie, I didn't really get invested any more than that. I'm definitely down to re-watch this one though, which I believe it will have--a rewatchability factor, that is. A lot has already been said about Drive, so I'll leave it to the abundance of analyses and reviews this movie currently has.",7
2019-11-29,As beautiful as it is violent. A great movie with a great cast. This is about as mainstream as Refn will ever get and even then there's that elevator scene. And the hotel room scene. And the restaurant scene. And the strip club scene...maybe this isn't all that mainstream.,10

2019-08-19,"Describing „Drive‘s“ genius to someone whos never seen it is quite difficult. Its a pretty over the top and clicheed crime movie–> thats also very calm and overturns genre tropes. Its a touching romance and a brutal revenge thriller. The best way to convince someone of the films greatness is to show them the massive amount of net-articles and youtube videos analysing the framing, the use of colour, the dialogue and other symbolism of this flick.

2020-12-10,"Gosling’s character descents into bloody violence to protect the helpess Irene, who’s innocence and kindness contrasts to his exploitive loser boss or the comic-esque villains that dominate the gloomy neo-noir atmosphere. At one point, as the protagonist is shown repeatedly stomping in another man’s skull, you start to wonder if his outwardly detached coolness isn’t just a reflection of what’s inside — and especially what’s *not* inside. Suffering from this same kind of emptiness, the film’s well-polished style is reduced to artifice, and skill-full establishment of moods covering up a real lack of emotion.

It’s actually beautiful with masterful cinematography and a soundtrack that transports you directly into the film next to Gosling who, without hardly saying a word, can command so much screen presence with his eyes alone.

While the film has a few leaps in logic that keep it from that five star rating, I can easily see…",9

The stylish direction and flair from Refn, the perfect electro song choices and synth-infused score, the stupendous cinematography, the satisfying lap dissolves, the compelling story and the strong performances (mainly from Ryan Gosling's nuanced, stoic demeanor, Carey Mulligan and Albert Brooks), all work flawlessly. The violence utilized is so sporadically effective, as it serves the story.",10

All side performances were great, especially Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan who never fail to impress me. It's Ryan Gosling who really shines here; he barely speaks any lines yet manages to convey…",7

2022-02-15,I just LOVE movies that are atmospheric and moody. There’s a lot of violence in this but it feels hard hitting and not gratuitous and just for shocks. The characters are not monsters and they care for each other which is hard to find in such movies.They could’ve easily made this a ‘R Rated Action Michael Bay’ Flick but it’s much more than that.,8

2022-01-15,"Cinematography, editing, lighting, music: DRIVE is a brilliant experience on an audiovisual level. Highly influenced by Walter Hill's classic THE DRIVER from 1978, Nicolas Winding Refn created a riveting and hyper-stylized blend of arthouse and mainstream; a brooding mood piece that erupts into violence in the closing act. It's still as exciting as when I first saw it in the cinema.",9

It's a great film, but I don't find the idea original enough like the rest of this film. I think ""Drive"" can be compared to ""Scarface"" which I think is a film you love as a child but later you think it's crap.

The action sequences reminded me of Baby Driver, even though I don’t think they are as good. And the ending broke my heart but it was necessary. ",9
2021-05-25,"Drive's simplicity is in a word, beautiful. The movie puts you on a subtle ride that knows how to use uncomplicated plot into whole new level. From score to Ryan Gosling, Drive is a different genre than action films. It chose to ameliorate its simple concepts to have a beatiful product and its fun, stylish, and entertaining. Drive appears to be a classic, and a classic it shall be.",9

I loved Gyllenhal in Amazing Spider-Man but I don't fucking understand what he's trying to go for in this movie. ",1

The soundtrack is one of the all-time greats and only adds to the aforementioned tone. These aren't the only good qualities, however. Ryan Gosling delivers a career-best performance, the cinematography, colors, direction, and pacing are all excellent. I think about this film a lot and for good reason.

2019-11-25,"Reviewing Drive, the great Roger Ebert writes that ""Carrey Mulligan is the template for vulnerability"". She's the best, and so is Ryan Gosling. He's made my year end list of top movie characters two years in a row, and this one he'll make it in my year end top movie moments. If Mulligan is quiet fragility, Gosling is solemn nostalgia. I once wrote that no actor does dejected misery better than he does (sorry, Joaquin Phoenix), and the performance he delivers in Drive is…",8
2019-11-23,"What many people might see as shallow, I see as poetic and layered. Especially with the driver. He may come off as an emotionless robot but there’s so many layers to his character. It’s the story of a real life Pinocchio, a real life fairy tale, a real human bean.",10

So many wise choices in terms of those visuals. Iconography that's fueled fan art since release. There was an odd level of respect given to each character. None of them feel tossed as a foil; each has their own personal stakes. ,9
,I worked at a movie theater when this came out and we had all these sweet people who were misled by the trailer and then tried to get refunds because they thought it was gonna be the fast & the furious.

The warmth and fuzz and softness from the beginning juxtaposed with the harshness and depravity and gore as the movie progresses really captures the Driver’s experience as he seemingly struggles to confront what arguably is his predisposition for darkness and violence.

,It remains one of the closest films in spirit to that of Sergio Leone & Quentin Tarantino at displaying groundbreaking layers of cinematic passion in the 21st century. Nicolas Winding Refn lands a unique masterpiece that was perfect upon first viewing & only seems better on every re-watch as it creates a dreamy universe entirely of its own. The cinematography & soundtrack are particularly perfect all throughout as it seems to draw influence from Martin Scorsese & John Carpenter at displaying a breathtaking perspective…,10

2024-05-04,Seeing this in the cinema after having not rewatched it in a few years was a euphoric experience. One of the most romantic films ever made? Seeing it after The Fall Guy was unintended but it is insane to watch 2 “Ryan Gosling as stunt man” movies come at that premise from completely opposite perspectives.

2024-05-03,"It's got some of the best cinematography I've ever seen with the coolest mother fucker Whoever walked the Earth.

I think this has a unique presence and a unique feel to it that throughout the entire movie just seems to give you the sense of peace. The movie does have a great story. It's something that could be turned into a revenge film. Quite easy and over the top action movie but this is done with cinematography and sound in mind and ensemble…,10

I'm probably not the first to point this out, but I think that he is our own generation's version of the silent protagonist with a slight twist. Firstly, I think this trope might have skipped a generation since the era of Eastwood and McQueen- at least in the mainstream. Between then, the trope was more like a parody of itself or…",10

2024-05-02,"Was drawn to the film through the popularity of Ryan Gosling over the last year or two. Truly an enjoyable watch. The idea of not having the main character use a name outside of “the driver” is such a great direction choice as it leads to mystery even after the film is over. What was thought to be an action movie, was kinda swayed slightly due to the opening act more so being a romance story. Choice of music was phenomenal along with the acting, I for sure will 100% be watching this film at least a good few times.",10

This is great on so many levels: the Cliff Martinez score/music curation, the cinematography/lighting/shot framing, the casting, costume design, and just the neo-noir vibes.

I know every guy is like ""literally me"", but for those of us who feel like a socially awkward-outcast-loner, it's hard not to feel that way. Could there be more dialouge? Absolutely. Could characters be more developed? Absolutely. I think the lack of those really add the charm for viewers like myself to insert themselves more into the character.

In addition, the performances are uniformly excellent. Gosling plays the quiet loner with the appropriate amount of intensity. Mulligan suggests a warm, kind person with few…",10

It’s nicely paced the ending is melancholy yet satisfying, and the cinematography makes it true eye candy. The highlight of this film is the music, and it knows it, by rewarding you with sharp synth cutting through the scene, and ethereal chorus that gives the viewer a state of immersion.

Masterful exploration of the three point lighting system and subsequent lacktherof, an amazing cast, relatable characters, and just the right amount of violence will forever cement this movie in my top ten. On my fourth watch I started to fall somewhat out of love with the film and it’s borderline melodramatic one liners, but I’m so glad I persevered.

Hypnotic, tense, ultra violent, and utterly brutal. One of my fave roles of Ryan Gosling. He's so nuanced/subtle & stoic in his performance.

Nicolas Winding Refn crafted a tense and gorgeous neo-noir thriller that is patient and deliberate. It’s so meticulous with every shot, line of dialogue, and action sequence.

It’s a hyper violent male gazey mess of a movie and I don’t know why people like it so much or why there is a consensus that it’s way better than Only God Forgives.

2023-11-08,Not good (some might even say STANDARD but I think it’s worse than that). Very unserious with a very forced relationship. Start to end could not get into it. I really don’t like this guys films,2

Women treat each other as a friend to be made; with that, they support each other and act on a base of friendliness. Men see each other as enemies or threats until proven otherwise. Because of this, men want to be better, smarter, and stronger than each other, creating a competition between men. ",2
2023-08-31,this was probably the most boring movie i’ve ever seen in my entire life,2

THIS is what you guys hyped up? i've seen this film being discussed in the same breath as Taxi Driver and Fight Club, and yeah, i can see this being a ""literally me"" film bro flick, but the aforementioned titles CLEAR this fucking film. it's not necessarily bad; it's got some cool shots sprinkled in and an interesting soundtrack, but GOD it was so underwhelming. ",2

2023-08-17,This movie was made for men. Great concept but every aspect is taken too far. Very minimal dialogue in this film. Which is done for stylistic purposes. Looks cool but ruins the pacing. Ryan Gosling's performance is truly excellent however it can't save this movie from its overly violent themes. ,2
2023-08-16,how could this movie possibly have such a high average rating. what a complete waste of a couple hours,2
2023-08-16,holy overrated,2

2023-01-14,It’s always risky to cast a neurotypical actor in the role of a  neurodivergent character. In this case it seems to have worked but only because the awkward gaps in conversation and the abnormally long eye contact was misinterpreted by viewers as some sort of dreamy unspoken love progression.  The musical score was brilliant. The dissonance between some of the scenes and the accompanying background music at first seems confusing but makes much more sense when the movie is seen…,2

2022-12-29,"This is the most incredibly boring and confusing movie I’ve ever seen, especially more disappointing because of my high hopes for it. There is little to no dialogue in the beginning and I’d say the beginning was slow but that would be an insult to slow-walking zombies and movies that are on pause. I don’t get the hype - maybe a clash of personal preference.",2
2022-12-27,"This is like if you made a version of baby driver that's only digestible by people with boy autism. Rank, pointless, overindulgent to a fault, boring. Learn to talk to people.",2
2022-12-25,"too boring to be an action movie, too shallow to be a drama movie. ryan gosling spoke like two sentences clearly during this shitstorm.",2
2022-12-23,"It's been a long time since I watched a movie that made me feel so little. The characters are bland, without personality or depth, the director wedges his favorite music into the film as if he were putting on his playlist at a party, without harmony and view. At the end the main character doesn't even join the girl he made suffer, he's not even a little appreciable. Lame",2
2022-12-19,This is just baby driver but way worse,2
2022-12-19,OoOoh it's so pretty,2
2022-12-17,I would’ve liked some movie in my nothing,2
2022-12-16,overhyped and pointless.,2
2022-12-15,Fucking boring. Fuck you.,2
2022-12-14,"Was somewhat promising at the very start, but as it went on I couldn't stand it. Such a banal and boring movie. I also realized I can't stand ryan gosling while watching this",2
2022-12-13,can’t believe ryan gosling went thru all that trouble to fuck that guys wife,2
2022-12-11,clark made me watch this and now I hate Italian people and slow motion,2

2022-12-05,it was just bad. Don’t watch this movie.,2
2022-12-04,ryan gosling playing the silent game for 100 minutes,2
2022-11-29,the amount of missed potential is driving me insane,2
2022-11-28,This movie was bad with capital B! Really nothing going one but plain characters and boring dialog. Basic ass action…,2
2022-11-17,The film can be summerized by good music with slow motion. We can ask ourselves if the slow motion are not only to make the film longer. Almost no plot. It so commercial. Girls seems dum and fragile. Violence just to keep spectators with suspense.,2
,"No character development, he got out of the city just the way he got into the city. He ruined a family and 2 local mobsters and got out.",2
2022-11-08,It’s just Ryan gosling staring at the camera for two hours,2
2022-11-08,this shit was boring and slow. Ryan gosling gives such a shit performance and most of the dialouge is boring and at times just cringy..,2
2022-11-03,I hated this,2
2022-11-03,"Ryan Gosling’s face and acting takes away from everything else this otherwise great film has to offer. Such a waste of an incredible soundtrack and otherwise decent plot. The audience is expected to make something meaningful of his pathetic face staring at things, which is frankly impossible the casting. So much dialogue was removed for the sake of forcing me to look at his face longer, which was a terrible decision. Also he doesn’t deserve the romantic lead whatsoever and…",2
2022-11-02,What the fuck did I just watch? ,2
2022-10-31,I had zero connection to any character in this movie.,2
2022-10-30,Rubbish I lost interest.,2
2022-10-28,this is one of the worst fucking movies i’ve ever seen but i loved evil anthony bordain,2
2022-10-19,"Downvote me all you want i don't care, there gotta be other people out there who think this movie was boring as hell..",2
2022-10-16,The movie is the definition of bad.,2
2022-10-11,I was gonna call this a glorified Neil Breen movie but Breen with this budget could probably make something better,2
2022-10-09,I was bored to tears,2
,"film was incredibly boring and the soundtrack used was very cringe to listen to. ryan gosling is such an expressionless actor which just made it worse. the plot made no sense yet still very uninteresting. they tried to make the female main character's husband a bad guy and even though he is annoying and a red flag, she still cheated on him and made the male main character the good guy who is also a red flag.",2
2022-10-08,"Got so boring, awkward, and stupid, I stopped watching it.",2
2022-10-03,Shittiest movie ive ever seen,2
2022-09-27,Fuck you this movie is so boring,2
2022-09-25,Trash,2
2022-09-18,"Best part was the first 10 minutes, movie called drive but driving is not the main point. Also very strange pacing, made the whole movie extremely boring to watch. Even the scenes that were supposed to be good really felt like they were trying to cover for the rest of the movies lack of cohesive story telling. Overall a mess and very lack luster. If you want to watch a good Gossling movie literally pick anything else. ",2
2022-09-17,"I rewatched this with a friend and…… it’s just as I expected. The main “drive” of this film is the romance which I felt no chemistry or literally any type of emotion from. Speaking of lack of emotion, Ryan Gosling gives such an emotionless effortless performance. And I get it he’s supposed to be an introvert but introverts in other films have showed emotion or inner conflict. Yeah the score is good and it’s not the worst thing ever but it really is just a style over substance film that people have overrated to a monstrous degree.",2
2022-09-15,it is painfully obvious why this movie is popular with incels and redditors,2
2022-09-06,If you catch Standard doing bad stuff do NOT prosecute him. That is on ME. He's just a little guy.,2
2022-09-06,still gets the same review sorry the soundtrack goes hard though,2
2022-09-06,I couldn’t care less for any of the characters in this movie. I got so bored. Didn’t finish,2
2022-08-25,"This fails for me in a quite remarkable manner. I like the premise, I like the cast (I'm rather meh on Gosling, but the rest I have liked in other things). And absolutely nothing about the realization of this movie. I get that it ""breaks with genre expectations"", but it does so in a way where everything feels drenched in valium, nobody talks remotely human, the music is frankly weird. I will not finish it and whatever points I will…",2
2022-08-25,Bad script. Feels pretentious overall.,2
2022-08-21,i sad . not great movie when sad . i don’t feel like a real human being . i wann pass out .,2
2022-08-16,I was really looking forward to this and walked away severely disappointed. Every interesting point was just left on the table in exchange for dead eyed stares and long emotionless pauses.I did enjoy the elevator scene for what it's worth.,2
2022-08-15,this did not do it for me. At All. oscar isaac looked sexy asf for his 2 minutes of screentime though,2
2022-08-15,im not even going to pretend i enjoyed this,2
2022-08-15,This was how my driving test went,2
2022-08-09,I will never have high expectations for a movie again,2
,one star for carey mulligan,2
2022-08-05,one star only for ryan gosling's little gloves,2
2022-08-02,The film tries so hard to be edgy and full of 'meaning' that it forgets to be enjoyable. ,2
2022-07-26,"The Boring Version of Baby DriverRobotic Ryan Gosling Performancea Movie Named DRIVE and there weren't Driving in itone of the worst movie scenarios ever, if not the worst.what a joke that movie is.",2
2022-07-26,did not finish cos meh,2
2022-07-19,"Whoever wrote the review on Baby Driver citing this movie as much more ""up-front"" than that film deserves to get their skull cracked up like a watermelon by Ryan Gosling and have their head examined. This movie makes Baby Driver look like world-class cinema. I want to scream, that's how bad this film was.",2
2022-07-18,This was as boring as watching paint dry,2
2022-07-16,I don’t wanna get my license anymore after how boring this was.,2
2022-07-15,Boring,2
2022-07-15,"I really didn’t like anything about this movie. The plot was basic, the acting (especially Ryan Gosling) got on my nerves, the action scenes were excessively gory, I predicted the plot twist, the elevator scene that people are raving about was super uncomfortable, and the whole movie was unintentionally unrealistic which also made me upset. ",2
2022-07-12,Fuck this movie. It sucks eggs. Rated 1 dumb fucking movie out of 5,2
2022-07-11,Ruined too many young men's perception about life. Also that jacket was ugly af.,2
,that was boring,2
2022-07-09,i will turn a blind eye to some things but others i CANNOT like the fact that people actually like and praise this movie. it wasn't the most terrible experience - at worst you'll get pretty bored but nothing to throw yourself out of the window - but yall really should love yourselves more you deserve something less crappy to watch,2
2022-07-08,I didn't think that the sequel to license to drive could be that bloody,2
2022-07-07,It's every nazi shithead's favourite movie for a reason.,2
2022-07-06,and here comes every sigma male saying 'u didn't undestand the movie' stfu it's boring af,2
,'drive' more like '2h of ryan gosling wearing the ugliest effing jacket in the whole wide world only to make a silly metaphor towards the end',2
2022-07-02,damn that sucked,2
2022-06-29,"Overrated, slow, and boring. At first I thought Gosling's character was stoic on purpose but no, he just has 0 emotion. It feels like the majority of the people stare blankly into space and don't react to what's going on around them. There are so many hanging shots and that makes me notice the blank staring even more.",2
2022-06-28,it was ok,2
2022-06-27,so overrated,2
2022-06-26,i hated the soundtrack and costume design. there was such a bland plot istg you guys are forcing yourselves to like this movie cus wtf was that,2

2022-05-23,Boring. So fucking boring. Ryan Gosling's character is incredibly dull. The other characters are one dimensional. This movie is a waste of time.,2
2022-05-20,A star for the amazing soundtrack. That is all.,2

2022-05-03,This has had a lot of good reviews to I decided to give it a watch. I got about 30 minutes in and god bored. Very slow paced film. Was jus rlly boring.,2
,"lil nicky ref discovered italo disco revivalism 4 years after it happened and thought he'd make a fake deep movie about it by filming baby goose staring out some windows in male silence for 2 hours. this movie is so, so dumb. it's a maxim magazine brought to life. christina hendricks rules as always, though i also hated the way she was used here narratively and in terms of character. in conclusion, i hate this stupid, bad movie.",2

2022-04-10,not sure how i feel about ryan gosling smiling in pure silence,2
2022-04-10,because making out for a whole minute in the elevator while there is a man with a gun planning to kill you is definitely normal,2
2022-04-01,I’d rather watch plants grow,2
2022-03-31,Why do people like this?,2
,It's just shit initial d isn't it,2
2022-03-24,I watched this movie on a plane and it was only marginally better than staring at the floor,2

,is that the bald guy from breaking bad?,2
2022-03-15,"i’m gonna be honest i was underwhelmed by this, i expected it to be more exciting considering how popular it is and maybe i missed a point but this isn’t really for me. it’s slow and doesn’t feel like it led up to anything worth watching, kinda felt like it was shock value without any emotional impact. pretty cinematography tho and i liked the opening car chase",2
2022-03-14,immediately forgot what it was about after it was over,2
2022-03-09,Nicolas Winding Refn you took 100 minutes of my life and I want them back.,2

2022-02-19,my dude was silent the whole time,2
,"After seeing it I was convinced all positive reviews were ironic. For ironic consumption it turns out to be quite fun to watch, but the poorly aged vaporwave aesthetic, the interactions that seem bland at best and painfully awkward and creepy at worst, really leave you expectant for the violence scenes to disctract you from the plot. I would like and maybe even come back to this film for a laugh if it wasn't so critically acclaimed. The fact that it is makes me so mad, I hate it.",2
2022-02-14,nothe star is for the gorgeous driving scene and nothing elseee,2
2022-02-09,Not engaging enough for me to pay full attention. Ruby seemed to like it. My favourite part was hanging my washing up mid way through.,2
2022-02-05,this movie actually sucks no matter what film bros tell you. gratuitous violence and the obsession with the lonely white man,2

2022-02-01,"It's the dad from Malcolm in the Middle! That's it. That's all I liked. Otherwise, I thought the plot was very generic and the characters didn't interest me at all. The acting was very bad in general.",2

2022-01-19,i don't understand why this is rated so highly... Ryan Gosling was great tho,2
2022-01-18,I think I might have hated this movie if I wasn't too busy zoning out from all the awkward silences,2
2022-01-18,this is my honest review. this film sucks ass and stay clear of me if you enjoy it!The lighting gives me depression,2
2022-01-17,this is not a good movie. girl neighbor  of course had no personality besides enjoying going on car rides and cheating. This movie is like what new girl is for boring girls who want to feel a little special. This movie is for boring quiet guys who likes to drive their car all day and this is the fantasy for them that you can totallyyyy still get a girlfriend with a kid to entertain your savior complex as if you’re…,2
2022-01-16,"I was bored the entire time watching this one. I’m not a fan of Ryan Gosling, but I went in open-minded and hoped for the best… Completely flat and unremarkable.",2
2022-01-13,"I will not elaborate on this. But basically Ryan Gosling uttering like three words the entire time, breaking people’s heads and being a massive simp for a hoe who was literally mid. like she fr did not show one bit of consideration the entire time. horrible, horrible movie. this felt like one of those movies a film major male manipulator would recommend because he thinks he’s sooo unique for knowing it and even goes so far as to call it an “obscure” film even tho netflix literally had it for the longest time.",2
,"I am def not the target audience for this movie. The writers had to be like ""what movies do real men like?"" and then proceeded to add everything they could think of. this movie is meant for men who don't get bitches. The only way I can picture a 'male' watching this, is on his belly with his feet up and swaying.",2
2022-01-09,Why do these people stare at each other in silence so much.,2
2022-01-02,a chatice me surpreendeu,2
2021-12-29,This movie lowkey sucks ass. Ryan gosling isn’t even that hot. He comes across as a weirdo with no social skills in this movie and his jacket is tacky. The movie is not nearly violent enough. I also don’t really like vapor wave music. The real human being song was awful. Bryan Cranston was my favorite part of this movie.,2
2021-12-20,Only good part was the music,2
2021-12-17,if I wanted to watch a white man just stare off into space and only say two words in the span of two hours I would have got stoned with my white friends. a waste of my time.,2
,I have absolutely no idea why people think this movie is good? Anyway I really wanted to watch it because of a greentext going around and I am now even more baffled.,2
2021-12-13,never seen it but every man i know that has i hate so it cannot be good but mmmmmmmmmmmmmm ryan gosling,2

2021-10-22,"Absolute joke of a film, an embarrassment to the film community. What were the directors thinking when they thought a movie about a “get away driver” was a good idea for a film. The name especially, that is what really changed the movie from a 2 star to a 1 star.",2
2021-10-17,Aggressively slow to the point that I completely switched off and then tuned back in to wanton violence of some description on several occasions with no idea how we got there. Seems well made but a full movie of long silent stares and night time car rides is just not for me. I'm willing to accept I 'just didn't get it' but I just did not get it.,2

,from ryan gosling's domineering puppy eyes to his infuriating yet endearing shit eating grin drive demonstrates that even with generic acting a film can be carried through its writing cinematography and direction. nicolas wind and rain manages to pace the film engagingly while setting a delicate balance between slow emotional and fast-paced action yet despite his best efforts at crafting a cinematic and poignant classic drive ultimately falls short of steve job's best work and ultimate legacy the masterpiece from pixar Ratatouille,2

2021-07-28,Idc if someone had a gun to my head i’d still rather never watch a Ryan Gosling movie,2
,i get the sense that gosling is well received by the american population because he seems to represent some sort of all american boy(?) but seriously... does he even act? or is he just there to look relatable to the american audience? at least show SOME emotion.,2

2021-06-04,"Ugh. Came for Ryan Gosling, but even he could not save this trash fire of a movie. Every single god damn shot was a slow camera pan. Contrary to Refn's belief, slow != tension. All this did was slow down the plot, simply for the sake of being slow. This had the effect of destroying the already convulted plot. I had to wait so god damn long for a scene to play out that, by the time I got to…",2

That one part when he drove was pretty cool, for like, a few minutes. Romantic chemistry is oozing out of every line between Simp and Stacy tho.

There are many similarities in the premise and plot, but there’s one major difference: Baby Driver is actually a fun movie. Honestly, for a movie called Drive one would think there’d be more than one car chase in the whole thing. This movie wants to be described as a “slow burn” and yeah, it’s slow alright. Hardly anything of…",3
2024-04-15,this has been on my watchlist for over 10 years and for what.... random violent mess that barely makes any sense at all,3
2024-04-12,"Disappointed by the lack of driving for a film called Drive. In all seriousness …. nah, this films bad. Ryan Gosling needs to learn to speak. Also more cars.",3

2024-04-06,fucking horrible. waste of 4 dollars boring as shit. i did come in expecting a really fun action movie tho. around the second half when the action came some of it was shocking whicb was entertaining to an extent but it didnt really do much for the movie as a wholealso think im officially a ryan gosling hater,3

I'm genuinely disgusted with this movie's relationship with women. The entire scene in which the naked, exposed women just stand and watch as two dangerous men fight and talk is horrible. Why don't they run from a dangerous situation when they're completely vulnerable? They are there for decoration, they are nothing but…",3

2024-02-18,This is such a fucking mess by director Nicolas Winding Refn it really makes no sense chronologically and the acting is so strained it feels like a 90's episode of Dallas.Clearly an admirer of Ryan Gosling using him again two years later in Only God Fogives with the same dreary direction .I think other than its main attraction of being a driving movie nothing else really appeals for me .,3
2024-02-17,carey mulligan and son get tossed around like ragdolls by countless less interesting and insufferable excuses for characters who pass time by killing each other and saying “fuck” a loti liked the pink font and opening sequence and some of the music but they all teased at a movie i’d like a lot better,3

It felt like it was about to lead to something, to get somewhere. But it never did. Because of this, it felt shorter than it actually is. I spent the whole movie thinking this was simply the set up for the actual story, but it…",3

,This movie stinks man,3
2024-02-09,Maybe I have tiktok attention span but there was so much staring at each other with watery eyes and long pauses between husky dialogue that I aged 10 years.

2024-01-02,This movie is definitely not for me. The first sequence is the best and it gets progressively worse and overly violent from there. Not to mention an utterly unsatisfying ending.,3

I'm an F1 fan but somehow I'm not interested by a film where a bloke just drives around, which says a lot.

2023-12-09,this movie… sucks lol. the only things giving this any credit are oscar isaac and bryan cranston. ryan goslings performance is so lifeless and sure maybe that was the point but ugh it was so boring and the romantic subplot felt so forced and fake like WHY WOULD SHE LIKE THIS GUY!?!? the soundtrack is also so not the vibe of the movie it’s more the vibe the movie is TRYING to be and failing. plot also was all over the fucking place,3

2023-10-10,This was just not a good movie. It’s like a really cheap copy Baby Driver (even tho it was first) but so so much worse.Literally nothing engaging happens in this movie and my interest in anything going on was just not there especially in the second half of the movie.I don’t usually care or notice anything about bad dialogue in movies but it was so bad in this. And so many scenes seemed so awkward when they shouldn’t have been.,3

2023-10-01,"Maybe I just ""didn't get it,"" but I pretty much didn't like anything about this film. It's somehow bizarre and boring at the same time, and none of the characters were interesting or engaging. The performances were solid, but idk I just didn't have fun watching this",3
2023-09-27,"never liked this movie. im not mad at refn but he's part of that crowd that obviously worships all the cinema that came before him which is boring. i mean, you could have worse influences but plenty of that stuff exists already. i guess thats why people like it",3

2023-08-17,"Can’t fault the title. He definitely drove but for such a star studded cast it was extremely boring and one dimensional. Ryan Gosling had as much emotion as Ken the doll, like the actual doll.

2023-08-16,"The film starts off somewhat entertaining and has wanting to see where things are going, but I felt like mid-way it just completely loses the plot. Especially in the second half of the film after the robbery I would say is where it loses its direction. The pacing and lack of dialogue definitely didn’t help either. The action/violence heavy scenes and the soundtrack were really the only enjoyable things about it. I wanted to like it because of Ryan Gosling but I just didn’t really enjoy it at all. Also Oscar Isaac’s character being named Standard just annoyed me idk.",3

I guess that comes with the mafia setting but idk other movies about the mafia aren’t so boring in terms of acting.The plot is fine but the tone and general direction really brings it down for me.

2023-07-24,i must’ve missed something bc man that was dull,3

2023-07-01,i would give ryan gosling a 5* uber rating i reckon,3
2023-06-28,Disappointing. They had a great cast but they wasted their potential due to a shit script. Gosling barely had any lines it came to the point where I thought it was because of a budgeting issue. Pacing was slow and I wish we saw more of what Gosling did before meeting Mulligan. The soundtrack was also jarring and felt out of place. There was promise in the trailer so it was disappointing for the story to be ultimately about a simp’s plan that goes wrong,3

2023-06-01,Kind of a fucking mess. Just a dead boring thriller at the end of the day. It's as if they took Taxi Driver and removed all the voiceover narration so it's just awkward silence and Ryan Gosling staring at shit like those fucking youtube videos of The Big Bang Theory with no laugh track. I get that it's supposed to be a part of the character but like it made it impossible to get even the slightest bit emotionally invested.…,3

,"Drive is an unsuccessful adaptation of previously released crime films. Becoming an awkward fusion of action, crime, drama, racing and romance, the films overall message is clouded by muddy genre overlaps. The characters are underwhelming and the plot isn’t anything we haven't seen before",3

The movie tries to be a romantic drama with hints of action and thriller mixed in, but I feel as if it miserably fails to do all these things.

2020-08-05,"The character development was so poor that I couldn't even feel the slightest bit sympathetic for ""Driver"" at any point in the film. Honestly, I wouldn't have even cared if he died. This movie made no sense.",3
2020-08-02,It may have helped if they could have done something to help me care about his character in the beginning. Or ANY of them. Even the kid. No one has any real personality or individual human qualities for me to attach myself to.,3
2020-08-01,"I've been putting this movie off since it came out nine years ago, because I had a hunch I wouldn't enjoy it. But, the nagging sight of it on a couple of lists I have been working through finally convinced me to check it out. I was actually glad I decided to watch it for about the first hour, but then the content started to show up that I knew was coming. I think I have a fairly pristine track…",3

2020-07-29,painfully boring i did not see the appeal and no i didn't finish it i just skipped to the last scene because of how uninterested i was. ,3
2020-07-28,Absolute fucking horseshit. The fact that it has a 4 average rating is egregious and laughable. Everyone who gave it over 3 stars needs to be tested for methamphetamines. The only saving grace of this movie was a good sound track.,3

2020-07-21,why did they make this movie?,3
2020-07-10,"Good plot line and alright choice of cast to play each character. I just don’t feel like this the right role for Ryan Gosling, every movie he is the lead in his portrayed character never shuts the fuck up and he barely speaks in this one. Movie also switches genres quite often from love story to action thriller to drama and back to love story. The climax is too long and dragged out and very predictable.",3
2020-07-06,"Weird and disturbing. I thought I would love it with the opening driving scene, but it was all downhill from there. The romance feels so artificial and there’s no relatable connection between the two - they just sort of look at each other the time.Didn’t really get the message or had any takeaways from the movie after watching it, which I feel every film should do.Don’t see why people like this movie",3
2020-07-06,My professional opinion is that this movie is boring and I can’t believe I wasted my time like that just for Ryan Gosling.,3
2020-06-27,"Staring: The Movie. This film as a whole is like a character. It's depressed, lonely, and melodramatic. I'm not into it. Technically, it's well done though.",3

2020-06-25,I really didn’t like this movie much at all,3

2020-06-19,"What a horrible movie. My expectations were high before I saw the movie, but that's not why I feel bad about the movie. In this movie, people become super-dangerous criminals without any background and then you ask what the reason is and you find the answer in violent scenes. In these scenes, violence is only added for the sake of beauty so that the viewers can enjoy it, while violence is not beautiful.So the whole movie goes forward for the…",3

2020-06-15,"Is the whole love behind this movie just that dudes want to be cool? Because this is my second time watching it and I still can’t understand why people love it. It’s a major bore, the screenplay is shallow and beyond predictable, and even the production design is incredibly basic.",3
2020-06-10,very stupid movie. almost no redeeming qualities.,3

,That dang smirk he gives throughout the whole film like he is smelling a fart. And he just. Won’t. Talk. But the woman finds him so mysterious and seductive? The blaring score couldn’t distract me from the mediocreness of the plot.,3
2020-05-08,the movie was marketed as an action movie so I thought I was watching an action movie so I didn't like it. ,3
2020-05-01,34I have a hard time understanding why people like this movie so much. The only positives for me where the great transition shots and Ryan Gosling's perfromance. Moving past that Drive has mediocre dialogue and an unnecessary amount of random gore. It somewhat reminds me of A Good Time except with a linear story and an ok plot. I felt like with a story like this they could have had more build up because the climax is non-existent. The…,3
2020-05-01,This is the most cardboard fucking movie I have ever watched holy shit its only saving grace is that Ryan gosling is hot and the movie is sometimes pretty but the soundtrack made me want to remove my ears and the acting was so dry I needed fucking eye drops,3
2020-04-25,"I hate action movies....very bloody, awful mid 2000s soundtrack that try’s too much with the daft punk. Ryan gosling is so weird and his relationship w the mom is weird",3
2020-04-22,"Not a good film. Ryan Gosling's character was so shallow and undeveloped that it hurt. Every scene he was in was so painfully awkward and hard to watch. The acting as a whole wasn't anything to behold at all, with the exception of Ron Perlman. He is the only one who did at least average in my opinion. The story was kind of slow and boring in the beginning. It got SLIGHTLY better towards the end but not by much.…",3

2020-04-08,honestly why do y'all like this movie? it's boring as hell and more of the same wtf the only pleasant thing was ryan gosling,3
,the way ryan gosling stares at carey mulligan after bashing some dudes brains out in an elevator? hilarious,3
,An awareness raising film about an autistic man obsessed with cars who develops a romantic interest in his next door neighbour. His obsession with cars makes it difficult for him to relate to his love interest in a normal way. In the first half hour of the film he literally takes her on four or five completely silent drives in his car. The ratio of car drive dates to normal interactions involving actual dialogue is completely out of whack but…,3
2020-03-30,"Far too violent, gory and boring. It didn't even have a good plot. Like some viewers have already mentioned, the female character is only used as a plot device. The tone weirdly shifts from peaceful to ultra violent for no reason. Drive is a movie which doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.",3
2020-03-29,I really didn’t like it :(,3
,sorry I was bored but at least some of the music was vibey,3
2020-03-19,What?! I watched this because someone said it was in their top three movies of all time. They are out of their ever living mind. Maybe if you love an extremely violent revenge movie about a quiet guy that drives ok? There was virtually no plot to this movie at all. I thought for the first 45 minutes we were going to get a cool romance about a quiet guy that could hold his own living a kind of double…,3
2020-03-19,"Amazing Vfx, Sfx and cinematography. But the story is incredibly slow and uneventful, it was challenging not to check my phone while watching it due to sheer unintrest.I will not watch this again and reccomend against it, thus even though some elements are great, I won't reccomend.",3
2020-03-18,"the plot of this movie made sense approximately 2% of the runtime. this movie was trying to be so many different things and ended up doing none of them well. the dialogue was poop, the characters were poop, and the soundtrack felt so awkward and out of place",3

What did that bring to his character,…",3
2020-03-08,"Sorry Danes, I don’t know why y’all love this Refn guy so much. The movie was more disjointed than Agent Michael Scarn. Sounds like Gabe Lewis wrote the soundtrack too.",3

Ryan Gosling has the same dumb expression during this whole movie, which, if this was a rom com, would be FINE because he would have more than a total of ten words to speak. Fuck the one dimensional female characters. I’m glad that one black actress got to get a check from her short appearance in the background of a shot. She met…",3

2019-12-18,"So yeah this is awful? I watched this for the first time since like, 2012 and I completely forgot how hollow and genuinely unpleasant this movie is.
