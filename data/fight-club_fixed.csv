All the rampant quoting of Durden-isms after Fight Club was released (and into today too) only exemplifies the apparently widespread attitude that Tyler is a model for what men should be. I wonder though, does the fault lie in the audience for misreading, or in David Fincher for glamorizing Durden's ideology?",

The only problem I had was that the story is almost too kinetic and fast-paced in the beginning of the film. Is that even a criticism? I still think Se7en is the better of the two masterpieces but this film has become a touchstone of pop culture and yet, it's themes about consumerism and alienation from the self are still relevant today.

2020-06-09,"""Fight Club"" is something like the other side of a medal that he shares with ""American Beauty"", but which was received much more positively and, unlike Fincher's anti-everything crusher, was showered with prizes. In the long run, ""Fight Club"" won the race. At least when it comes to my taste and general tenor. Which of course can and should not take anything from the brilliance of ""American Beauty"" 's. ""Fight Club"" is and remains something very special, another fat highlight‚Ä¶",10.0

Only that I can‚Äôt stand bonham Carters annoying character and that the movie is sometimes a bit too strange and not really my style are things I can‚Äôt like.
