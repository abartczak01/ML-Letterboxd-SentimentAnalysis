,Never has there been a film which I have identified more with.,6.0
2024-06-13,"Funny, scary, and a wild time, Bale is a fantastic lead. Was it real? Up to the viewer I guess, but I believe most of it happened. So funny, Bateman basically reads like a modern day influencer trying to put on this air of superiority publicly around his peers, while hiding the monster inside. Music drops are fun too!",8.0

2024-06-13,This is singlehandedly the funniest movie the most eating (fairly) silent commentary on poverty and the one percent and it ALSO has christian bale and reese witherspoon I died dead died died he would hate me #9threwatchin2years,10.0
2024-06-13,I killed paul allen.. and I LIKED IT genuinely one of the funniest movies to date,8.0
2024-06-14,A twisted social satire mocking the yuppie culture of the 80s. We watch as a man falls deeper into insanity and goes great lengths to quench his growing bloodlust. The unreliable narrator leaves you wondering if anything in the film even happened.,10.0

2024-06-13,"My wife talking about how much she loves her metal credit card caused me to want to re-watch of one of my favourite films. The book is better, but this adaptation is as perfect as you can get. As I get older, the psychological aspect of Patrick‚Äôs mental illness make more sense, and I still love the vapidness of the characters. The soundtrack is what makes this a masterpiece on my mind.",10.0

2024-06-13,"Is there a film more present in the public lexicon than American Psycho? I feel like every corner of the small world I live in is somewhat occupied by this film, whether it be references or otherwise. Maybe it's just my generation or the circle in which I find myself in, but this thing is everywhere, and for good reason ‚Äî people like Bateman are out there.

2024-06-13,the least i've enjoyed this film so far but i still really liked it. It felt a bit unfocused and i feel the messages and themes that it tried to present could have been presented better. however Christian Bale as Bateman is an almost undisputable top 10 performance ever.,8.0

2024-06-13,Christian Bale circa 2000 that‚Äôs all,8.0
2024-06-13,"The movie was truly terrifying! I‚Äôm not good with watching this kind of horror but the story is extremely realistic. Patrick Bateman‚Äôs obsessions, ego and lack of self control is something many people struggle with. It‚Äôs truly terrifying watching how manipulative he is but unfortunately many people with personality disorders come across in this way. They may not kill but many who struggle with it have similar personality traits to Patrick Bateman.¬†",10.0

2024-06-14,"Why did I give 4.5/5 to this movie?To understand why, we should have a light knowledge of the main character. ""Patrick Bateman"" is the comprehensive character of the perfection of humankind in modern time, having the physical perfection of beauty, power and health, having the perfect mind of knowledge and taste.This isn't enough, the special thing is Patrick Bateman isn't a cheap character but a sociopath, a well written one, it's not just cool but a complete amazing character which made the movie as incredible as it's.",9.0

Are fantasies and daydreams real experience and do they help make us who we are, or do they only do so when they spill over into the tangible world?

I've been reading comments and reviews, and people have so many different opinions on the actual narrative and meaning of the film, some even question wether Bateman was even real. I can see why that's the case. But in the end, we as the audience are just as lost as Bateman is in the film. So we get to interpret everything however we want.",8.0

It expertly depicts a hidden psycho in the corporate finance world but also pokes merciless fun at his very madness.

Literate and needle sharp, Harron's film skewers a banal, capitalism inhaling, masculine type that lives and breathes money, materialism, and, in the case of Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman, murder. Bale ideally embodies that type with a sort of Gordon Gekko-meets-Skeletor tortured whimsy, rolling through Harron's sanitized and polished compositions with a devilish and superficial wink.

Christian Bale's performance is beyond iconic, perfectly pulling off a sociopath with no real emotions who just wants to ""fit in"".
