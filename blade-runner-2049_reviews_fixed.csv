2024-06-13,A well shot film with great acting that falls a little flat bc of the length and the rather un-climactic ending  of the huge reveal that should’ve had even bigger implications when you consider the world going back to the first film. All around a great sequel.,8.0

2024-06-13,"One of the best Ridley Scott films, also one of the best of its own genre.Revolves around a postmodern narrative theme,The performances in this film are awestruck.The cgi and the visuals are absolutely mind-blowing.The movie starts off slow but intense.Yes it is the sort of film you need to see more than once to be understandable/appreciated but the story is very compelling and very deep thematically.Would’ve been an easy 5 star if it wasn’t slow but the visuals and the atmosphere top it off.",8.0

2024-06-12,"This movie is to Blade Runner what Aliens was to Alien, a sequel that is just about the same quality while maintaining a tone that is completely different from the original. My only complaint is that Denis Villeneuve used his trademark “stretching the run time more than necessary” card and it is felt when watching the film. If the plot was a little tighter and fast-paced, Blade Runner 2049 would have been as easy 5/5. Fortunately, the slightly bloated length barely takes away from 2049 and it’s among the best sci-fi movies I’ve seen from either past or modern times.",9.0
2024-06-12,great retake on a older franchise,9.0
2024-06-12,"Beautiful film. I don't think it captures the same vibe and emotion as the first one, but Villeneuve managed to extend Scott's universe in a clever original way.Obviously, Roger Deakins' cinematography is simply the best, and combining this to amazing settings, a great soundtrack, and Ryan Gosling as the lead actor, nothing can go wrong.",9.0

2024-06-12,"Denis Villeneuve should just make all of the movies guys ngl. This was what I was wanting out of the first movie but completely realized. The visuals alone had me changing my pants for every shot (😶). The only downside was whenever Dr. Michael Morbius said ""it's morbin' time"" and Morbiused all over the place, but I guess Jared Leto had a good performance or whatever.",10.0

2024-06-12,"Somehow someway the great blade runner was surpassed by a sequel made more than two decades later. This film is more enthralling while also not being able to exist without the first one. Playing heavily into the subject matter of its predecessor, this film portrays a better love story. Great performances from all actors in the film it stays in time with the year that it was made but definitely feels like a return to the world created in the first film. I can always rewatch this film and thats saying something as it is almost three hours long.",10.0

2024-06-12,"When I watched Blade Runner 2049 for the first time at the cinema it felt slow and somewhat emotionless.But re-watching it immediately after re-watching the original blew me away! Visually stunning, it deepens the themes of the first film and asks questions about humanity. I have never felt so much emotion from such an ambiguous film. Give it a second chance!",9.0
2024-06-12,"Overall a pretty mid film. Improves on some aspects that the last one was short of but still falls to many of the same flaws. Story that doesn’t feel earned, characters that are uninteresting, and goes on for way to long with many unnecessary scenes that don't do anything for the plot. Duneis Villanueva let me down with this one and not sure why these movies are as popular as they are.",6.0

2024-06-12,Probably would prefer the book,5.0
2024-06-12,"A sequel that takes the best philosophical dilemmas presented in the originals and makes them even more intense and salient. The dialectic between humans and replicants is strong and moving. Is being human to have free will? What does that mean? Or is it simply to feel? Or participate in a greater cause? The cyberpunk futurism beautifully investigates what the line between human and machine while simultaneously deconstructing the messianic character trope. Like the first blade runner, the movie ends with one of the most thought-provoking and meaningful death scenes. “Dying for the right cause. It's the most human thing we can do.”",10.0

2024-06-11,"Second half collapses in on itself. Infinitely less thought provoking and entrancingly beautiful than the first. It feels almost unfair to compare the two but no sequel can ever operate in a vacuum and this suffers as a result. Cartoonishly presents its moral questions as well as Villeneuve again presenting twists with far too much hand holding. The final scene as the reveal for the identity of the replicant child would be perfect. Deakins is a god but, the art direction feels too clinical and the narrative too removed for this depiction of the universe to feel real and alive.",5.0

2024-06-08,"this is a movie i wish i'd watched a long time ago. though the first is gorgeous and perfect at setting its scenes, there's something about this one that is even further haunting and captivating. i'd say the first succeeds at visual storytelling on another level, but here, it's the acting that stands out, asides from harrison ford's somewhat lackluster performance at time, but it's harrison ford, so who can really be mad or surprised there.",8.0

2017-10-05,"Denis Villeneuve has directed six movies since 2010 and still he manages to make each one stand out in its own right, this one being no exception. Not only does Blade Runner 2049 improve upon its predecessor, but it connects with it on a level that's more about immersive worldbuilding than cheap nostalgia.

2017-10-03,"Blade Runner 2049 opens to limited screens tonight, nationwide tomorrow, and expectations are high.

Unfortunately, admiration for this semi-spinoff/semi-sequel, for the most part, also ends with its world.

I felt like they could have cut a decent amount from this and still had a pretty great film. Outside of that, I really don't have any complaints.",7.0

Its futuristic setting is advanced yet primitive, gripping and isolating. It feels gritty. It feels dirty.

But beyond that, this film is a magnificent accomplishment. The fact that the first is better is not a failure of this film, but a testament to the greatness of the original.

2024-05-15,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is a masterpiece, plain and simple. Denis Villeneuve's direction is nothing short of brilliant, seamlessly expanding upon the universe created by Ridley Scott.The film's visuals are breathtaking, immersing you in a dystopian future like no other. From its haunting score to its thought-provoking storytelling.Despite the slower tempo, every moment feels purposeful, allowing for deeper exploration of themes and character development. ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a cinematic triumph and easily one of my all-time favorites.",10.0

2023-12-11,"A sequel is, by its very nature, derivative. But the fact that there’s nothing “original” about BLADE RUNNER 2049 — especially compared to its progenitor, which is essentially groundbreaking in every way — isn’t what makes the film a miss for me. “Originality” is overrated in my opinion anyway (for one, it’s entirely dependent on context — what’s original to one person might be something someone else has seen a hundred times — and for another, there’s no carbon dating…",4.0

2023-11-30,"Of the remakes and sequels produced in recent memory, this is one of the most unnecessary. It accomplishes little, barks platitudes at the audience, repeats itself at an increasing frequency as the end approaches, and features less than stellar writing.
