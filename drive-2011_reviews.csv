2024-06-13,"‚Ä¢1/2 a star for spiderman 2099‚Ä¢1/2 a star for hellboy‚Ä¢1/2 a star for the gore, blood etc (which I wanted so much more of)‚Ä¢-3 and a 1/2 stars the pacing drove me insane and felt like torture. For the first hour it felt like nothing happened, I honestly don't care for the relationship between Irene and Ryan Gosling. I smiled so hard when the credits rolled (not for the film itself, because it was finally over)",3
2024-06-13,got like half an hour in and nothing happening and got bored and forgot about it but ryan gosling is so shy and cute!! ü•∞,6

2024-06-13,Walter whiteI feel like driver smiled like once this whole movie,8
2024-06-10,"a movie that i would i like to say was a brilliant one. The idea of this movie just to show us that to have a good ending, its doesnt always with the main character had a happy life with his beloved one. Instead, this movie show us how can be the driver and the girl (irene) going a separate ways, knowing that everything is finally over.",6
2024-06-13,an extra star cus he‚Äôs hot,6
2024-06-13,Mid at best but yes the whole vibe is pretty cool.,6

2024-06-12,Ranking things my Dad has doneSaying that Nightcall sucks -100/10Not cool Robert,9
2024-04-07,"Highly overrated movie amidst its cult following, imo. I found the pacing and dialogue boring and disjointed rather than minimalistic and profound, and the ultra violence never really felt earned or purposeful. The music is okay, but even there I was expecting to be blown away in the vein of Hotline Miami. Maybe I came in with it having been too hyped up for me, but this movie is just not it lol",4
2024-06-12,"üé∂ real human being, and a real hero, real human being üé∂",10
2024-06-13,I think most of my praise comes from the beautiful opening scene playing nightcall‚Ä¶,7
2024-06-12,"there‚Äôs something inside you, it‚Äôs hard to explain",10
2024-06-12,I hated the music so much dear god,7
2024-06-13,I watched this film at home on Wednesday the 12th of June 2024. I got recommended this film by a friend quite a long time ago now and I finally ended up watching it today. I‚Äôm really glad that I decided to choose this as my final film before going away because I thoroughly enjoyed it and don‚Äôt think that I would‚Äôve preferred any of my other options. This film did so many things well and I don‚Äôt think that‚Ä¶,9
2024-06-12,Go Clippers?,9
2024-06-12,re-reviewing after yearsbrotherman is the coldest character in all of fiction simultaneously in a cool way and a stupid asshole braindead no social cues genuine psychopath way as wellliterally Not meexcellent film though,10
2024-06-12,"Think this one was too hyped up for me, I liked it a lot, I love the people in it, but whatever makes it 5 stars for most people must have gone right over my head",8
2024-06-12,I can see why people really like this movie and also why critics love it and the general audience doesn‚Äôt. Entertaining but personally it feels like it‚Äôs takes too much time being artsy for me to really enjoy it. Idk I enjoyed it but it just felt a little pretentious,7
2024-06-12,"Was not expecting that much gore or that kind of ending at all, but still a great movie. The driving scenes are so immersive and interesting, and Ryan‚Äôs acting in this is so good. He really is able to do so much with so little words. Almost halfway through this movie I thought it was gonna go a completely different way then it did, but I think I liked not being able to guess what was gonna happen next.",9
2024-06-12,"A sea of frogs. The shark circles a pair of scorpions, stingers poised. A sacrificial razor drawn, toothpicks tucked away behind the ear. She can hear the dripping from his wound, the car door isn't even open. Silent soft smiles guttered underneath the glass littering the highway.",7
2024-06-12,You‚Äôre never gonna guess what he does in this movie.,6
2024-06-12,"Honestly I don‚Äôt see why people like this movie so much. I wasn‚Äôt invested in the characters and the writing fell flat. I get what they were doing with the lack of dialogue, letting subtext, composition, and whatever else tell the story, but honestly it came off as more gimmicky.",6
2024-06-12,"Finally, I DRIVE.¬†",7
2024-06-12,"Ryan Gosling is not just another pretty face on screen. I was glued into the story from the start. This is my first time watching this movie and he's good! The fact that he can go from this to Ken in Barbie, incredible.",8
2024-06-12,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,8
2023-12-14,"Top 5 Gosling movie. I believe there isn‚Äôt really a unique way to review this movie because of its popularity, so I‚Äôm not gonna make this review long to me it‚Äôs pretty self explanatory, it‚Äôs popular because it‚Äôs good. Great soundtrack, great visuals, great story, starts off a tad bit slow but picks up pace quickly, I‚Äôm instantly hooked from that opening scene though. Nightfall fits it perfectly.¬†",8
2024-06-13,Baby Driver with more synth. 3.5/5,7
2024-06-12,Holy soundtrack,8
2024-06-12,"Third time I've watched Drive, but this time with my mom",10
2024-06-12,"THERES SOMETHING INSIDE YOU, ITS HARD TO EXPLAINüò´",8
2024-06-12,"First time since opening weekend and man‚Ä¶..IMMEDIATE thought is how fucking horrifying Albert Brooks is my GOD. Even with such little dialogue from Gosling it just all works so damn well. The moments with Benicio and Irene are beautiful. The opening sequence fucks all day long. As soon as that cop-ter identifies him with the spotlight and he punches the throttle, that‚Äôs the stuff. What a picture.",8
2024-06-13,"Absolute top level execution of a story that feels like it's been done before. There is no dig in that, that's all compliment.",8
2024-06-13,"¬øWhat were you waiting for?, it's Ryanü´¶ü´¶üòç",10
2024-05-25,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,8
2024-06-12,Wish Goslings character was actually intimidating üò≠ I cant unsee the golden retriever in him,7
2024-06-12,literally me,9
2024-06-12,now playing getaway car by taylor swift,5
2024-06-12,ron perlman looks and sounds like the ghost of christmas past from scrooged¬†in this,
2024-06-12,Everyone seemingly relates to an autistic coded Ryan Gosling in a movie who‚Äôs script drives away from the plot.,5
2024-06-12,So good it worked on a drive in .,10
2024-06-12,"Cool, stylish and sad",8
2024-06-12,"Drive (2011) was such a good watch successfully blending action, romance and suspense! Some of the things I appreciated :)",8
2024-06-12,i forgot i made a movie about myself in 2011,8
2024-06-12,i paid my driver's license to feel like him... y am I paying taxes now?,7
2024-06-12,"on a second watch, i conclude that everything about this is perfect. acting, cinematography, soundtrack, visuals, storytelling, everything. absolute cinema. also i like watching ryan gosling staring at people for 5 seconds without telling anything, and then saying 'okay/yeah/sure'",10
2024-06-12,Him and that toothpick üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è,8
2024-06-12,Can you guess what the main character does,9
2024-06-12,progressively got worse as it went on but first half was so good. i‚Äôm such a hater of overdoing action and gore in films,7
2024-06-12,"good enough movie. I like the character of driver more than the movie itself, but it wasn't a bad movie. horrible soundtrack that was close to being good. I would watch it again if someone else wanted to see it.",6
2024-06-12,Maybe I don't want to be a sigma,5
2024-06-13,Watching Ryan gosling perform in drive is worth while your time. Ryan's silent tone throughout the movie,8
2024-06-12,I feel like I would have enjoyed this movie more if it had more women in it,6
2024-06-12,"Bro. Just bro. Again, this guy is literally me. And yes, I have nothing better to do. In conclusion , one of my favorite movies, give it a go.",10
2024-06-12,this is my silly little movie <3,9
2024-06-12,Kinda cringe,5
2024-06-12,"It was sooo visually pleasant and stylish. Especially I really like the opening part so much how his character was quickly established, the thrilling action with the great music, and the title logoüòç it was just so wholesome. But the only thing is that I didn‚Äôt expect it to be this much western style (not sure if I‚Äôm correct) so there was some part I didn‚Äôt really expect to see and not sure if I liked it for the first watchü•≤ but overall I really liked it",8
2024-06-12,Wait..he did the exact same thumbs up in ‚ÄúDrive‚Äù as in ‚ÄúThe Fall Guy‚Äù. What the h‚Ç¨ck?,6
2024-06-12,"Drive is meh. Ryan Gosling‚Äôs acting is strangely monotone. A lot of violence happens for seemingly no reason to me. There are some good action sequences, but a lot of emotional scenes go on for too long. Really just a basic vigilante movie, and Baby Driver did the getaway driver thing better.",6
2024-06-12,"You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. No matter what. Anything happens a minute either side of that and you're on your own.",10
2024-06-13,bro is so autistic its not even funny,5
2024-06-12,he drove and i watched it. pretty cool,8

2024-06-12,"Gosling steals every minute of this Movie, one of my absolute favourites of his¬†",10
2024-06-12,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,7
2024-06-12,Ryan Gosling kills this in one of his best performances. I found so many little details and nuisances in his performance this time that I had missed before. On first watch he can feel robotic or soulless but it‚Äôs abundantly evident that there is a full world inside. His eyes say so much.,9
2024-06-07,If I had a nickel for each time I watched a movie that started with a banging car chase and insane sound track I‚Äôd have two nickels etc,6
2024-06-12,great movie that i only watched because I liked the soundtrack!,10

2024-06-12,"Literally me. Had to he said, on a real I like this film the lack of dialogue from the main character makes for a nice change and definitely enhances the film",8
2024-06-12,Just watched Drive honest rating from me it is a 5.5 out of 10 ,5
2024-06-12,That bloody face of him. Justt BRUTAL!!!!!. Cant get it outta my mind fr.,7
2024-06-12,"‚Ä¢ Among the best scores / soundtracks ever‚Ä¢ An amazing introduction‚Ä¢ Immaculate direction, sound and cinematography‚Ä¢ An intense and diabolically cold work‚Ä¢ An excellent balance between calm and outbreaks of violence",10
2024-06-12,Incredible silent storytelling,7
2024-06-12,Watched This. Its the epic movie guys.,7

2024-06-11,Loved the aesthetic and the style of film. Music choice is nostalgic an the dialogue and acting is something unique compared to movies of recent times. Director really does story telling in a visual way whether the actors expressions or the scenes of the movie.,8

2024-06-11,Slightly poorly mad. There was a lot more violence than usual in an action/thriller. Didn‚Äôt bother me though. What did were the unusually long completely silent scenes. ??,4

2024-06-11,"If people tell you this film is boring, then they missed that part in the elevator - this film hits you when you least expect it. It's a perfect movie: such sparse dialogue, and yet so rich in character and world-building. ",10
2024-06-11,Wish I could be as cool and mysterious as Ryan Gosling in this but unfortunately it just comes off as autistic and off-putting 90% of the time,9

2024-06-10,Ryan Gosling¬†is as good here as he has ever been. I think I‚Äôd put a few that came after this above it but this shows he has great range in a quiet but commanding performance. He has a strong chemistry with Carey Mulligan¬†and the slow but methodical way their relationship develops is a strength of the movie. It‚Äôs also packed with a ton of quality supporting performances and strong violence.,9

2024-06-09,"Probably says something about the pacing that the description blurb on here gives away the entire first half of the movie. I‚Äôd wager a full third of *that* is just Ryan Gosling staring blankly or doing a golden retriever smile. Still, once it picks up, oooo-weeee is it worth it.",8

2024-06-10,Autistic guy drives car fast and says 5 words,9
2024-06-09,"My mouth was dry the entirety of this movie because it stressed me out in a very compelling way. Ryan Gosling has very tiny ears. I never noticed that before this movie, but that's probably why Baby Driver is so different. Ryan Gosling can't fit earbuds into his ears.",8

2024-06-02,"I don't know what stick I had up my butt the first time I saw this, but it's a pretty slick crime movie. (changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars) The violence is real gross and I'm not usually a fan of plots where man becomes the ultimate badass by killing people, but he's a reluctant killer, and as it turns out, violence doesn't solve all his problems.",8

2024-06-09,"Do you identify as a sigma male? If you answered ""yes"", then this movie is a must watch. After completely altering my personality to match that of the driver's, my swag meter is through the roof! If I met the driver in person, I would say something along the lines of: ""Driver from Drive, you saved my life"" with 12 seconds of silence after the comma for dramatic effect. Ryan Gosling is HIM.

I do think this has some poignant things to say about the nature of doing good things as a bad person, but I don't really think the method of delivery (lots of long glances with little dialogue) is necessarily the best way of going about it. those glances do allow for some incredible facial acting though.",7

2024-05-30,"Honestly, it was a very enjoyable movie, though it was a much slower pace than I was expecting, and hoping for. Ryan Gosling's acting as Driver was amazing, and he played the character well. Its quite a shocking difference between his character in Barbie (Ken), which I had seen before this.There were several moments where I expected one thing, but something else entirely happened!

2024-05-30,I CANT TAKE IT SERIOSULY IM SORRY idk what it is maybe the music or I was distracted but I was just laughing the whole time and it was so cringe I love Ryan Gosling but I just couldn't take it seriously. When the blonde girl slapped him HAHAHHA ill rewatch it some time I'm not distracted,4

2024-05-30,"Colt Seavers had a heck of an origin story, wow.",7
2024-05-30,"I was sucked in at the opening scene, epic music and a car chase? Sign me up. The main character says very little, but Ryan Gosling conveys so much through his eyes and facial expressions. He is truly an incredible actor. I will say I was left wishing I knew more about the driver...but I am just now realizing (after a google search) that his name is ""Driver"" so I guess that was on purpose. In conclusion: I am on a mission to watch all of Ryan Gosling's films and weep.",7

2024-05-29,"Drive is one hell of a cool film. The soundtrack is stellar, its plot is emotional, the chase scenes are impressively exhilarating, and Ryan Gosling‚Äôs performance depicts one of the most badass characters I‚Äôve seen. A seemingly calm, cool, and collected guy implodes and viscously defends his love. The atmosphere the film places its viewers in is spectacular.

2024-05-29,Top top,10
2024-05-29,"I'm not entirely sure why so many people love this movie. A good chuck of the film is conveyed through 'meaningful' looks because 'its not what said, but what isn't said' - but how are we supposed to connect with the characters if they barely say anything and retain a constant emotionless look. There were too many weird silences which were portrayed as endearing and edgy. This movie has reminded me of why I'm not much of a fan of‚Ä¶",5

2024-05-27,This movies performances are subtle but powerful at the same time. You care for Driver and Irene as soon as they meet each other and want that to work even though you‚Äôre rooting for Standard and his family at the same time. Both Oscar Isaac and Bryan Cranston were amazing in their roles for the limited amount of time they were on screen.,9

2024-05-27,"It‚Äôs a story about fighting the person you are and working towards the person you want to be. It acknowledges the good, the bad, and the ugly that exists within Driver; but, the story is about Driver becoming a hero in his own way, by directing his bad and ugly actions toward the good end of saving Irene and Benicio.

We don't know his character's backstory - all we know is he is an expert driver and mechanic. It reminded me a bit of Gosling's The Place Beyond the Pines where he played a similar character. Gosling plays the part well and is helped by a strong supporting cast of Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac, Christina‚Ä¶",7

Gosling is amazing and then puts on an acting clinic with his delivery of minimal dialogue and his on screen presence. The writing, directing and cinematography are great as well as the acting from the supporting cast. That‚Äôs failing to mention the fact that this has a near perfect soundtrack to accompany this near perfect film.",9

2024-05-25,"This is a purely emotional movie for me. Refn, after his Copenhagen films, developed a high contrast, vibrant style where sound design carries all the weight. I see people complaining about the ""Under Your Spell"" scene, because it's bad that an audio-visual medium uses music and actor's faces to convey the thoughts in a character's head rather than them ""cleverly"" dictating to the audience. It's funny this at one time was considered pretentious because it's actually a very earnest and straightforward narrative.",10
2024-05-25,It‚Äôs alright. The dialogue scenes felt a bit too artsy for my taste and consisted of a lot more staring than I felt was necessary to set the mood. The violence also felt very gratuitous.,6

I liked the cinematography and the lighting and the music etc but the actual film it self seemed lacking.

2024-05-26,God damn I love this movie. One of those movies that kind of follows that Denis Villenueve principal of ‚Äúcinema is more about action and less about dialogue‚Äù because Gosling barely speaks.

,"Drive is my favourite film of 2011 thus far. Ryan Gosling is mindblowingly good as the intense 'Driver'. All of the performances are incredible, the cinematography is slick and stylish, and the soundtrack is utterly fantastic. I will never look at Gosling's handsome face in the same way again. Go and see this film!",10
,"As of October 27, my favourite film of 2011. I've been following Refn since the Pusher Trilogy, and this movie further proves him as the twisted lovechild of Kubrick and early Scorsese, all grown-up and seemingly immune to artistic compromise.",10
2011-10-28,"Definitely holds up on a second viewing. Extremely tense with great style and fantastic performances. I loved the use of reflective surfaces, that I didn't really pick up on the first time I saw it. The sound and audience were better at the Embassy when I saw it at NZIFF11, but I guess that was to be expected.",10

Starring a brilliant Gosling reunited with Blue Valentine love Williams (convince me Mulligan isn't her), Drive is a quiet yet brutal piece of cinema.",9

,"Good pace of plot, cinematography and acting.",9
2011-09-22,"With DRIVE director, Refn, successfully turns violent noir into an art film for the masses. Gosling oozes cool, star power whilst a gripping support cast throw their experienced chops into the mix to great effect. Ron Pearlman & Albert Brooks as Jewish criminal odd couple are particularly stand-out. If the emotional tone of the film loses its way at times this can be forgiven by the meditative beauty and smart economy of dialogue. One that requires a few more viewings...",8

They get talking, have a few drinks, and after things get hot and heavy, they agree to all go to someone's place. Fast and Furious needs to go the bathroom though, so the other two wait around until he's done, they hail a taxi and go back to Lynch's place. The next few hours are what Drive is like. ",7

2011-11-08,When I first saw the trailer for Drive I had high hopes and even with all the build up it still exceeded my expectations. Drive is some one those movies that comes close to perfection. Everything about it is amazing. There's great attention to detail and there needs to be because no shot is cut prematurely. You're given the time to take everything in and really feel the intensity.,10

2011-11-11,"I loved the pacing of this film; where most modern action flicks are non-stop go-go-go, Drive lets you savour the moment. The slow-mo pans and drawn-out pauses really let you chew things over and this really drew me in like no other film I've seen for quite some time.",10
2011-11-12,"I was expecting a lot from this movie but it didn't deliver. Through out the movie, the pace was so slow that I started reading news while waiting for something to happen. All the dialog and action could be summed up in a 5 minute clip.",4

Winding Refn certainly earned his Best Director award at Cannes this year, helped greatly by the outstanding performances of Gosling and Mulligan.

2011-11-12,"‚Äé'Drive': Holy shit is this a smart film or what? Perfectly matched soundtrack, absolutely stunning directing (to the point of showing off!) and another great acting performance by Ryan Gosling. The first act is a little slow, especially after a beautifully constructed opening sequence, but it does do a good job of building the tension for the rest of the film. Good shit.",10
,"I'm still chewing on this. There are parts I really enjoyed, and parts I absolutely despised. I imagine that's by design, but it was still hard for me to get behind it. I'll say this though: Beautifully shot, loved the sound and music, and Ryan Gosling did a great job. That first chase scene was a sight to behold.",6
2011-11-11,"I only saw 3.5 stars worth of this movie, as the R18 violence was beyond my personal violence threshold. But Gosling was 3.5/3.5 stars worth of hotness to re-emerge from behind boyfriend's shoulder for.",7

2011-11-09,It was good.,7
2011-11-08,Great but a little to violent for my liking. And Gosling said very little,7
,"It is funny how the trailer makes the movie looks like a fast pace action one when in reality it is so quiet, slow, contemplative with great refinement. The play of all the actors are absolutely amazing. I really did enjoy the movie. And the soundtrack is so mind freezing. Cliff Martinez has created a masterpiece. I could listen to ""Where's the Deluxe Version"" endlessly.",8
,Loved the lo-fi tone of this movie and the synth-pop soundtrack. Totally not what I was expecting. This is what The Transporter would have been like if it were made in the early 80s.,8
,"Atmospheric and detached, punctuated by moments of shocking violence. Gosling is excellent, Brooks really embraced what could have been a standard villain role, and the soundtrack stuck in my head for weeks. The scene in the motel is what directing is about.",8
,It's been awhile since I last saw a movie that good. Drive is beautifully stylized and the story catch your breath!,10

,Straight in to my top five movies of all time....,10
,"Quite simply, this is a great LA movie. The more knowledge of this style of cinema you bring to it, the more you get out of it. Not just highly stylized and sophisticated eye candy - this is well written yet calculated for mainstream appeal. It‚Äôs best of genre stuff, and the first must-see film of the year for me.",9
,Ryan Gosling plays an autistic savant who's super powers include driving and murder.,6
2011-11-24,Thank god for Ryan Gosling being in this otherwise I'd have probably had my hands covering my eyes for the whole film thanks to the gore.,7
,Worth the price of admission for the opening sequence alone. Favorite movie of the year thus far.,
2011-11-29,"Gosling is epic in this movie. Master of silence, pace and ruining your face.",9
2011-11-29,This was my favorite film of the year. Perfect blend of Terminator 2 and Collateral; and the music was a spell:,9
,Too good. Wonderful in every way.,10
,Drive rocks the eighties better than the eighties did; It's Michael Mann on steroids. By the far the best film this year.,10
2011-12-06,Loved it! A roller coaster of a movie where the pace goes up and down. Excellent opening scene followed by quietness and excitement along the way. Oh ... and the font used for the title really sucks!,9
,"It was quite ok action movie, might watch it again in future.",7

2011-12-12,"Great filmmaking, great music! In the beginning it looks a bit dull, but it's getting better and better.",7
,"I went in expecting too much (especially given how Warrior lived up to the hype). I can't say I was disappointed‚Äîit's a good movie‚Äîbut it didn't unzip and blow me away. Good soundtrack, but nothing like what Daft Punk did with TRON:Legacy.",8
,Very surprising. Very brutal. I liked Albert Brooks in this a lot.,8

,Gosling and the soundtrack is amazing. The story isn't bad either but lacks that special something to get five stars.,9
2011-11-11,"The tech writer John Gruber is fond of a Kubrick quote about the truth of a thing being in the feel of it rather than the think of it, a phrase that for me perfectly explains the appeal of Nicolas Winding Refn‚Äôs noirish adaptation of the James Sallis novel. Right from the first hotel-room scene, through a near wordless fifteen-minute opening stanza, the foreboding atmosphere of an after-hours, back-streets Los Angeles takes hold. An ambient, minimal score by Cliff Martinez‚Ä¶",10

,"meh. Great supporting cast and some nice cinematography, but Gosling is a flat line dead fish throughout. I just don't see what everyone loves about that guy, other than the looks thing, I mean.",6
,"Pretty Spectacular. Soundtrack is brilliant and cinematography beautiful. Noirish and pulp references provide the film with texture, and refreshingly the director leaves the actors the emote in long takes. Not for everyone but deeply impressive piece if film",8
,"Interesting, but not a conventional film... I'm still not sure how I feel about Nicholas Winding Refn.",5
2011-12-09,"Drive is the story of a simple man who finds love with a semi-mute simple single mum. Their long silences don't feel awkward, as neither seems aware of what's happening. When it starts to feel like nothing is going to happen they go for a drive and nothing happens. Simple pleasures like finding a pond strewn with rubbish are enjoyed as if words could not and will not describe.",8
,"This is one of the movies on my must-watch list, but when I finally watched it I was greatly disappointed and puzzled. Disappointed, because I did not enjoy the movie very much; puzzled, because of all the praises I've read about this movie.",5
,Favorite of 2011. I loved everything about it. Meticulously well-crafted. Everything from the music in the opening sequence down to the ultra-violence was fitting and well-done.,10
,Feel-good movie of the year.,9

2011-12-20,Stylish and tense with equal helpings of loveliness and ultra-violance. What's not to like?,9
2011-12-20,I really don't see the hype about this movie at all. Well-balanced and pretty cinematography is about all it's got. It has an overall emptiness that the looks and style don't make up for.,6
2011-12-18,"This is one of the best films I've seen in recent years. It doesn't have much dialogue, but it's ok, it doesn't need it.

Drive is a thousand kinds of crazy cool - the sharp, bright colours, the awesome driving scenes, that epic throwback soundtrack.

2011-12-25,"It's a really good movie. Amazing soundtrack. I can't think of anything that should have been done differently. But ... it's not like it's any better than a typical episode of Breaking Bad. That's high praise, but this is a feature film, not an episode of basic-cable TV. So it left me wanting more. What's there is great, and the minimalism and tight focus is part of what makes it so great -- but it just feels a bit too lean to me.",8

,True power of silence.,10
,"It was hard to escape the hype surrounding this release, starring crowd-elected ladies man, Ryan Gosling. That didn't stop it from being a very good and enjoyable film. For the first third of the film the dialogue is sparse, but it slowly builds, much like the action.",8
,"This movie came out of left field. After seeing a trailer for a film that came across as ""Fast and the Furious"", my friends and I were shocked to see that the film had received many amazing ratings for respectable film critics (Ha!

,Ryan Gosling's a badass apparently.,
,"Born of Shane and Clint Eastwood and Heat and Ghost Dog, a beautiful modern-day fairy-tale told with a lullaby feel and hints of extreme violence. Gosling is resplendent as the superhuman hero, raging in suppressed savagery against the comic book villains to save the damsel in distress. Stunning.",9

2012-01-02,I liked it a lot!,8
2012-01-02,"This was a solid, well executed film, not entirely as vapid as the premise implies. The script is pretty predictable, the characters don't require a whole lot of acting chops, but the acting is good enough that it carries a pretty bland concept. Good directing, good cinematography. Overall a ""good"" film, nothing particularly spectacular about it, but Ryan Gosling is quickly becoming one of my favorite young actors.",7

2012-01-07,"I'm not a big fan of Ryan Gosling, but really enjoyed his performance in this film ‚Äì perhaps because he didn't have much dialogue to his character. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen, and along with the masterful soundtrack and sound design, are worth it for seeing this film. There are some clear homages to Taxi Driver, but I think this one stands on its own in keeping a certain calm/cool factor to each scene, no matter how tense. Above all, its a beautiful study of the interplay between shadow and light - which should be at the core of any film.",8
,Hands down my favourite film of 2011.,10
2012-01-09,"I like getting surprised while watching films. And i was surprised by how good Drive was. I was expecting something along the lines of 'Fast and Furious', but this film has just about enough depth and style to make it enjoyable. It seems like 2011 was the year of Ryan Gosling.",8

I like Ryan Gosling and was very glad to discover Carey Mulligan but I was still bored for much of the movie. It was hard to understand the protagonist‚Äôs motivation behind doing the things he did. It felt like I was out of the loop throughout the flick. I would not recommend it.",4
,"Essentially an extremely violent John Hughes movie, Nicolas Winding Refn directs with stylistic precision. A hard-boiled drama with impeccable performances and a spot-on soundtrack.",9

,"Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn won the Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival for his moody stunt driver drama, and it's easy to see why. Inspired by Bullitt and lots of ultra-pulpy noir, Drive is evocative of some great American films from the 70s.

,Favorite film of 2011. Miami Vice-esque titles/music set a strange tone right off the bat (especially in a theater). Gestures and glances played as much of a part as the dialogue.

Director Nicolas Winding Refn and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel were able to capture the metropolitan cityscape in a fashion that highlights the beauty of the city as well as exposes its seedy underbelly. Take the opening sequence for example; the audience is introduced to the unnamed main character, Driver, as he drives for two small time crooks‚Ä¶",10

2012-01-12,"Starts with pink 1980's font title sequence that would be at home in an early Madonna movie. Unlike Clooney's interest in making new films in a ""classic"" style (e.g. The American or Michael Clayton), this film seems to be the real deal. It's not a ""take"" on the era, it's a throwback. Quite weird.",8
2012-01-17,Reminded me a bit of a David Lynch flick.,7
,A stand-out in 2011. Music is repetitive but great. Gosling is the pinnacle of cool. Action scenes were simple but still had you at the edge of your seat. Buy it.,9
2011-09-20,"If you didn't like this film, you're just being contrary for the sake of being. Beautiful shots, amazing soundtrack and performances by Ryan Gosling & Albert Brooks that were unforgettable. A big recommend for any fan of action based noir.",10

,I seem to be in a minority of people who were completely underwhelmed and disappointed with this film. ,3
2012-01-18,"Its plot is far from groundbreaking, but it doesn't matter. Drive is exceptionally stylish and beautiful one second and absolutely terrifying the next. It has a unique atmosphere that manages to shrink an entire theatre to the size of a passengers seat (thank you Cliff Martinez).",8
,For me a top 5 film of 2011,8
,"Disappointed. Very stylish, but shallow movie. I wanted to like it so badly, but in the end I can‚Äôt recommend it.",4
2012-01-19,"A very good thriller. I really liked the character Gosling is playing. He looks innocent in the beginning, a person with good heart, but as soon the story continues the character develops into a cold blooded one.It is a unique picture. The style is so different compared to other thrillers. The ending is somewhat mysterious and open ended. So it might lead to a sequel, which I hope would never be announced. If there won't be a sequel then people will still talk about for years to come. Everybody having a different interpretation of the ending of the movie.",8
,Really nice movie!,10
2012-01-21,"Not at all as good as expected based on the hype, slow moving and quite boring at times, but some scenes makes up for it and pushes it to 3/5",6
2012-01-22,"Wow, this was a very good movie, acting instead of vocalizing the feelings the viewer should see. No stupid lets shock the viewers with maxed-out music & sound effects, but just moments of near silence and a beautiful set of sound tracks to match the atmosphere. Did find the violence a bit on the rough/bloody side.",8

,Kim Kardashian's last marriage was more believable than the actions of the driver.,5
,Quite possibly the coolest film of the 21st Century.,8
2011-10-16,Could have been so much before. A killer soundtrack and sleek look aren't enough to compensate for the lack of character development and simply cold feeling I was left with when I exited the theater.,5
,"Can I give this movie 10 stars?? Everything about this movie makes me want to marry it. The control, the exhilaration, the silence, the determination left such an impression on me. It deserves a Best Picture nomination in my opinion, but the Academy won't ever acknowledge a movie like this. Ryan Gosling is the man!",10
2011-12-22,"Saw this the day it opened, have seen it 4 more times theatrically. I additionally have a screener that I watch on a regular basis until I can buy the official DVD. I love Winding-Refn and I love this film.",10

,The arthouse enthusiast's answer to The Fast & The Furious. This film blends pure old school 80s style with some gripping action sequences and moments of shocking violence. Ryan Gosling and Albert Brooks are particular standouts amongst a very worthy cast.,9
,Brilliant! And I want his jacket minus the blood.,10
2012-01-14,"It's one of the best looking and sounding films I've scene for years. Los Angeles looked fantastic and the soundtrack complimented the cinematography beautifully. The only flaw was that at times I found myself waiting for something to happen, for it to jump up a notch, and I was slightly disappointed when it didn't. However I am probably being overly critical. Highly recommended",9
,Pure pulp fiction - Drive proves that style over substance isn't always a bad thing.,8

2011-11-14,"An awesome, nearly perfect thriller.",10
2011-09-16,"Amazing movie that was shot beautifully, cast well, and has a soundtrack that fits perfectly. To make it even more impressive, it was only an independent film with a small budget. All of the moronic Fast-and-Furious-Transformer-Michael-Bay-loving idiots are just mad because there weren't any unrealistic car chases or heists, no Vin Diesel, and no billion dollar budget. Favorite movie of 2011.",10
,"Nicolas Winding Refn makes a movie with the minimalist cool of Walter Hill, the existentialism of Jean Pierre Melville and the neo-noir atmosphere of early Michael Mann. A modern masterpiece.",10
2012-01-25,Believe the hype. This is a brutal and brilliant neon-noir and Gosling is the man.,10
,"What else is there to say about Drive at this point? This movie might as well have been a check-list of things I love: gritty 70s thriller feel (""Thief"" anyone?) with 80s throwback music? Check. Stoic yet emotional performance from the lead? Check. Carey Mulligan? Albert Brooks? Check and check. Worth the hype.",8
,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,7
2011-09-16,"Possibly the artsiest action film i've ever seen, but also one of the best.",8
,"I will never underestimate Ryan Gosling as an actor ever again. He delivers a fantastic performance as the mostly silent Driver who is out for revenge after a heist gone wrong. It balances sweet scenes of the Driver driving through the sunset and the violence acts he has to incur to protect the ones he cares about. I‚Äôm not gonna say much more about it, but you can read my review and then go see for yourself.",10
,My favorite film of 2011. Just damn cool.,8
2011-09-11,"That movie put some hair on my chest. Its not often that we have a movie that blends ultra violence with compelling story. ""Drive"" throws you against your seat and says ""Shutup, I'm driving."" Now before you continue to read on. I want to mention that I saw this movie without seeing the trailer or anything. The only thing I knew about this movie going in is the title and that it starred Ryan Gosling. I encourage anybody who sees‚Ä¶",10
,"What a good movie! Beautifully done. Had more gore than I thought it would and the title sequence was pink, but other than that, I thought it was great. Loved the twists and turns of the plot. It fulfilled my inner-post-modern baby.",
2012-01-02,Amazing performances from all involved. Ryan Gosling plays the driver in a subtle performance with menacing undertones of violence. Brilliant use of music in the film. Nicolas Winding Refn has put his finger on the synth-driven pulse of neo-noir 80s thrillers like Thief & To Live & Die In L.A..,9
,"Just loved this, beautiful violent movie.",9
,Just saw this a few weeks ago and I was blown away by the soundtrack!,7
,"You may get the wrong impression about Drive of you watch the trailer first. Is it a action movie like 'Transporter' were the special effects are more important the storyline? With Drive you couldn't be more far from the true. This is a character movie. Ryan Gosling in a good drama role, most of the time you don't know what his character is thinking and what would be his next move. Carey Mulligan plays a role we have seen her‚Ä¶",8
2011-12-28,Wow. Gosling is immense. The timing of the film is perfect. Out of nowhere this suave flick starts pumping and it never stops. Not the film of 2011 but certainly the surprise,9
,"One of my absolute favorite films of 2011, completely overlooked by the Oscar committee. And that's too bad.",10
2012-01-18,Perfect. One of the most intense opening sequences in recent memory. I felt like I was on a cinematic high watching this. Most of the film felt very surreal.,10

,This movie needs no explaining. One of the best movies I saw in 2011. Go watch!!,8
,"Take ¬ªThe Transporter¬´, remove the muscle character, add one with actual acting skills and profile.But also remove the action part of the story. And that's really a pity: Drive has so much potential, but I don't really like the calm atmosphere which is above all. It could have been a really really good action movie with a great actor. Like this it's just a ride on the indie rocket without engine ignition. (But that's what most people like about the film, so it seems to be just my problem.)",7
2012-01-26,"As skilled and suave as the driver we watch in awe for two hours, is the direction of Nicolas Winding Refn who tells a story about violence, isolation and the chaos that follows when you break the rules. You get a flavor from Michael Mann's movies, from Scorsese's Taxi Driver, but make no mistake, this movie stands alone in its own as one of the best film making examples of 2011. Awesome.",9
,"Though Drive is probably one of the slickest 'heist' films out there right now, and definitely one of the few existentialist crime films, it unfortunately left me a little cold. The problem isn't in the writing, acting or directing, its just that the film never quite lives up to the promise of that great opening scene. Still, a fantastic film, and a lot of fun to watch.",7

2011-12-15,"This is a pretty special picture: calm und suspenseful, cool and shy, sweet and violent. By consequently avoiding to draw clich√© stereotypes, Nicolas Winding Refn manages to create a modern classic.",7
2012-01-29,"Powerfull and beautifully directed. weakness? the screenplay. It¬¥s not about the lack of words. Sergio Leone and Takeshi Kitano builded pontent and deepest antiheroes from pratically mute characters. In Drive the plot is not believable-important-or different enough to care. An Indycar race turned into a ""just nice"" ride@cinetweetica",4
2012-01-30,"Great film - it's rather classic Refn, but on a whole new international level which suits him well. It reminds me of the Pusher trilogi with it's raw realistic violence. Going to re-watch this very soon again.",8

,"If there was any doubt that only total badasses can chew on toothpicks, without the desire to clean their teeth, Ryan Gosling puts that silly rumor to rest. Despite what it's title might imply, Drive is not your typical ricer-approved action movie that we all know and love nowadays.

,"Slick style and good acting/cast, but it didn't grab me as some other people. Need to re-watch this one.",7
,Ryan Gosling's 'Driver' is this generation's 'The Man With No Name'. Refn's auteur hand is visible throughout. The chase scenes are mature and tense; the violence may put some people off. The elevator scene was one of the best scenes I've seen in recent times. And the synth score is unlike any soundtrack heard before.,9

2012-02-01,"More a love story than straight-up action film, Nicolas Winding Refn's DRIVE deconstructs the ""cool hero"" archetype, delivering an absolutely beautiful and complex film that reveals an extra layer of depth on repeat viewings. Ryan Gosling comes the closest any actor ever has to channeling the late Steve McQueen, but makes the nameless Driver his own character.",10

,"Another stoic character study from Nicolas Winding Refn. Only this time instead of the mute ancient Scottish warrior of Valhalla Rising, we have only a slightly more talkative getaway driver in contemporary Los Angeles. It's a traditional Noir-ish double-cross crime movie oozing with an 80s visual aesthetic and a synth-pop soundtrack. With it's barebones narrative and lovingly preened costumes and set design, it has attracted complaints of style of content. It's all constructed with the typical flair the poster boy‚Ä¶",6

,"Winding-Refn's slow burn, pop crime study excites and unnerves all at once. As a meditation on genre (heist, thriller, action, car chase, horror) it excels without postmodern winks and nudges, all while offering a stripped down narrative that's as angsty and engrossing as its hero. Check out Vallhalla Rising for a more spiritual and experimental take on similar themes but, y'know, with Vikings.",10

,"There aren't enough superlatives in the dictionary to adequately explain my thoughts on this dazzling film. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's definetly my favorite film of 2011. It's a simple enough premise, a Hollywood stunt-driver by day and getaway driver for hire by night gets caught up in a tangled web of deception and villainy. The beauty here lies in the execution. Nicolas Windig Refn finally hits his stride, and he does so on all cylinders.‚Ä¶",9

I was seduced after the first 10 minutes thanks to an amazing intro.

The subtile tone of this movie is great, the directing with a 70s 80s retro‚Ä¶",10
2012-02-03,"Technically, the movie is perfect. As a whole, it is not. But it's damn close. This is an engrossing film all around. Its soundtrack and cinematography are remarkable, and even though the movie has little dialogue, the characters motivations and body language speak louder than words. Drive manages to be extremely violent, subtle and even romantic without ever shifting in tone.",10

2012-02-04,"Beautiful to look at, but ultimately somewhat empty. Gosling's silent act is all very well, but leaves you emotionally uninvolved. The reasoning behind the decisions he makes is never clear. Agreeing to help Standard then still pulling his 'I just drive' quote in particular jars - is he planning on going back to Irene and saying 'yeah, he was 30 seconds late so I left him behind'? It's still a solid genre piece, but could have been great if someone had told them that less isn't always more.",6

2012-01-24,"Mesmerizing. Very much a retro pastiche. But it isn't smug or obnoxious about being that. It seems to have been beamed in from an alternate universe. I can see why it didn't connect with everyone, though. Because it's very specific. And it's keyed to a very particular vibe. But, for those of us who ""get it,"" it's a rare gem of a movie.",8
2012-02-08,2nd viewing . . that scene in the motel midway through still comes as a shocker though!,
,"A lot like The Driver, but who care's? Phenomenally minimalistic, but full of life at the same time. Great film, may be the best of 2011. Nicolas Winding Refn is on a tear.",10
2012-02-08,"So cool! Summed up by one line ""How can he be good? There's no good sharks."" The performances in this film are fantastic and a good rule of thumb is to watch any film Mulligan choosss to be in because it will be good. The soundtrack is cool and the look is visually stunning. If it wasn't for thw ultraviolence this would have been an Oscar Nom for sure.",9
2011-07-21,Favorite movie of 2011,10
,"This movie may have less dialogue than Takeshi Kitano films, and that is saying something. Your emotional response to this will largely rest in what you read in the actor's silences and small gestures. The soundtrack is one of the very best of the year.",9
,"Nicely styled, but the difference in audio was quite frustrating",8
,This movie had a lot of hype and although it was good I didn't think it was that great. The hyper violent scenes come out of know where and I overall feel that they made the movie worse. I also wasn't a big fan of the soundtrack.,6
,"An unexpectedly dark story, where the director seemingly skipped over a bit of relationship development in order to make room for the dismal plot. I did enjoy the development of Ryan Gosling‚Äôs somewhat mysterious character, who is slowly revealed to be just as grim as the happenings that befall him.",7
,"I really liked this film, had a nice slow burn with good payoffs",8
,The driver may either be a gem of a character or so much of deliberate enigma that he's frustrating. The intensity is enough to make walls sweat and the soundtrack is highly stylish.,8
,Style over substances? Nah. Style with substance? Yesum.,10
,"Anchored by Gosling's performance, Drive is an uneven, occassionally overtly-measured but ultimately rewarding watch.",8
,Oh My Word,
,"The film many critics are rightly calling the coolest film of the year, is one of the highlights of Goslings career, which is saying a lot considering the successful year he's had",9

2012-02-10,Second watch of this for me and it still holds up incredibly well.,10
,It's basically one big music video of Ryan Goslings face.,2
2012-02-10,A very great opening. ,8
2012-01-21,"One of those unique films that catches you by surprise. The atmosphere created by the minimal dialogue from the main protagonist combined with the excellent soundtrack was definitely a major plus for the film. It certainly had a Taxi Driver-esque feel to it (one of my all-time favorite flicks), and it simply a well constructed movie. It's really easy to mess up a film like this and it could so easily have been boring - but that's what good film-making is all about...pulling off a masterstroke such as this.",8
2012-01-29,"Bam! The instant the opening credits drop, soundtracked by Kavinsky's glorious Nightcall, I'm there. Completely engrossed in this stylish thriller. ",9
,"Like audiovisual catnip, a true pleasure to watch. Stylized images, a sweet soundtrack and great cinematic composure. Went straight to my all-time favorites list.",10
,I expected a little more out of this. The plot is pretty dull and less complex than I was hoping. Gosling and Cranston are great per usual. Its worth the ride.,6
,"A mysterious Hollywood stuntman, mechanic and getaway driver lands himself in trouble when he helps out his neighbour. ",
2011-11-04,I don't know what all the fuss was about. It reminded me of a Brian DePalma movie on MDMA. And I mean that in a bad way.,4
,I have no idea why so many people lie this movie it sucked,1
2012-02-10,"Watching this film was like watching an old lady who can barely see over the steering wheel try to find the accelerator for 45 minutes, only to have her suddenly slam the pedal to the floor and drive full speed into a family of five, decapitating all the children. It started off quiet, peaceful and extremely boring, only to quickly morph into a graphically violent, predictable movie. The only reason it doesn't end up in my pile of ""Worst Movies Ever"" is due to the way it was carefully and beautifully shot. You're better off skipping this one and buying the soundtrack.",4

,Best movie of 2011,10
,"My fav movie of 2011, for some reason this movie has a real 80's feel to it with a fantastic soundtrack which might help give it the 80s feel. Love Ryan Gosling in a role which he doesn't tak much. Highly recommend this film to everyone",10
2012-02-08,"Fantastic. Superbly directed and acted. Still a bit undecided on whether the OTT ultra violence really fits the tone of the rest of the movie, i'm not saying it was ""too violent"" or anything Daily Mail-esque, but just not sure whether the violence needed to be of the splatter variety, although it was really well done, it kind of took me out of the film just a bit.",10
,One of the best films I have seen in some time. Definitely was not what I had expected. Also a very well done score.,9
,This reminded me of 28 weeks later. Why you ask? Well the first 15 minutes had me on the edge of my seat for the movie I was about to see... that never happend. This however was an excellent film anyway - but it had the potential to be so much more.,8
2012-02-10,"A beautifully rendered film, some solid performances and flashes of extreme violence define this all too familiar narrative. It is in it's glossy presentation that it succeeds. The soundtrack alone gives the film an extra star.",8

2011-09-24,"Far and away the best film of 2011, DRIVE is a brilliantly-paced, exciting, surprising, unexpected, and thoroughly entertaining journey through reality, fiction, violence, beauty, and business.",10
2011-12-08,Great take on the philosophical action genre.,7
,It was a challenge to determine what my number one film of the year was. Some years are easier than others and this year fell on the difficult side. It all came down to the film that stayed with me the most. The film that made me think and stood out when compared to everything else that came out this year. That film ended up being Drive. My appreciation for Drive has grown even greater long after I watched it‚Ä¶,10
,"I was in complete awe of Drive. It felt exactly like falling in love, overwhelming, everything resting on one moment, and so, so, so beautiful.",8
,My top film from 2011 and probably one of my favourite soundtracks in five years!,10

2012-02-11,"Perfectly stylish and brutal crime drama. Everything is top notch. More like this, please.",10
,"My pick of 2011, and reconfirmed with a viewing on Blu over the weekend.",10
,"well, i thought this was going to be a chick flick and then it took a left turn i didn't expect. actually it was the hammer to the face i didn't expect...",4
2012-02-11,"I see what they were trying to do, but unfortunately it just didn't come together for me. The cinematography was of high quality, but the dramatically extended frames and the breaks in dialogue often seemed forced. Thankfully, at times, this silence was relieved by a great soundtrack.",6
2012-02-11,"This is the second time I have watched this movie. Decided to watch again as it's been on my mind and it really is superb. Brought tears to my eyes twice, very touching. The simple touching of hands turned me to mush. Gosling is superb. The bad guys are superb. The tension in the opening credits is nerve jangling. The lighting in the elevator scene really gobsmacked me, it seemed to induce a tunnel vision and I was sucked right‚Ä¶",9
,A fantastic movie and my fave of 2011. How this was not nominated for a shit-ton of Oscars is beyond me!,10
2012-02-04,"If you like early-mid '80s action/thrillers, this is ripped from that time - the look, the music, even the credits font screams early Michael Mann. It has it's problems (mostly first-act), but I liked it nonetheless.",7
2012-02-12,"An amazing film, might be my favorite of 2011. And it's very different from almost anything Hollywood has been feeding for years.",9
,"One of the best of 2011 and one of three films from that year that, for this viewer, clinches Ryan Gosling as a must watch for any future projects.",10
,"The coolest, if not the best flick of 2011.",9
2012-02-10,"Reminiscent of 80's dramatic action films like Friedken's ""To Live and Die in L.A."" or Mann's ""Manhunter."" An oddly captivating film.",8
,"The hype train has left the station, but this is still a pretty great movie. Deeply regret jumping the gun and calling it the best of 2011 though, and doing so before seeing some of the many bounties that year had to offer",8
,"The title, Drive, left me expecting fast-paced action. I was waiting for the movie to take off until about half way through when it became apparent that it wasn't going to. That said Drive was positively fantastic at building suspense, the sound was fantastic, but in the end the pacing left me a bit displeased - probably because it wasn't what I expected.",7
2012-01-08,A well-crafted adrenaline ride with a fantastic set of supporting characters. Pulling together other aspects such as racing and stunt driving opened the film up to enormous possibilities. Ryan Gosling would also go on to star in a film where he is given a speaking role. ,10
2012-02-13,And you have proved to be a real human being. And a real hero.,10
,My favorite film of 2011.,10
,"Great Sound, Nice Movie, Great Screenplay",7
,"As the anticipation built from seeing the trailer for the first time, up to the moment when the opening scenes began, I have to say that this film took me into an unexpected journey that in the end left me immensely satisfied. With an amazing cast that in their subtlety took each character deeper, and could really only be appreciated by watching the nuances of their expressions, ""Drive"" transcended far beyond its dialogue. Managing to create a story that in‚Ä¶",8
2012-02-12,"Finally saw this crazy (and captivating!) film! It was a real ""slow burn"" of a movie, and one which left me completely enthralled. Haven't been able to stop thinking about it and it's slow ride into insanity since I saw it last night.",9
,"Awesome movie, it surprises you in every scene, it's amazing how it goes from an action movie to a love story to a thriller to a gory thing. It's like John Hughes trough the eyes of Tarantino. ",10
,"So stylish, so sexy and an incredibly surprising slow burn that really detonates near the end.",9
2012-02-13,Was a good film. I enjoyed it... But however I was hoping for a bit more...,7
,"Sure, the film was stylish as all hell, and Albert Brooks was a revelation. That still doesn't excuse the humdrum plot, cliched characters, and inexplicable performance by Ryan Gosling. Here's the clincher, though: watch the film again, only this time assume Gosling's driver has a developmental disorder. Suddenly the whole mess makes a lot more sense.",6
,"It's stylish, and features an enigmatic performance by Gosling, but the whole thing left me a bit cold.",5
,"If Charade is the best film HItchcock never made, then Drive is the best film that Michael Mann never made. I love the look of the film, the acting, mise-en-scene, music. What a blast.",10
2012-02-14,"Two stars. 1.5 for the movie, 0.5 for RG's Canadian tuxedo.",4
,"2nd watch BLURAY, stunningly beautiful,so amazing in it's choices to be quiet when playbook says go loud, Love this Flix",8
,"This film was awesome. This movie is the perfect example of a film that is all about the direction. I love movies that are simple but done differently and paced on the slower side. Ghost Dog comes to mind when watching this. Awesome cinematography and slow motion used brilliantly. The plot is very basic, a little on the weaker side, but because the direction is so superb, you're kept very intrigued. Albert Brooks was good. He wasn't nominated for this‚Ä¶",8
,"Loved it on first viewing, liked it even more second time around. Pretty much everything I want from a movie.",10
2012-02-13,"The action sequences are fantastic, but everything in between is too slow!",4
,"I don't really understand some of the criticism this has gotten for being boring...I've seen it multiple times now, and have enjoyed it more and more each time.",9
2012-02-16,"Stylistically superb and well crafted piece of cinema right here. Many shots reminded me of Lynch, and even some of the (some say) over the top graphic violence reminded me of Wild At Heart. Some of the shots, especially in the car sequences and how it followed Gosling's line of sight were really great. Refn admits to making ""Genre"" films and this is definitely one, but even in moments where I thought ""this is a film student's wet dream"" it instilled in me the aura of truly great cinema. Check it.",8
,So overrated.,6
2012-02-02,"Want to see the film that Michael Mann should have made between ""Thief"" and ""Manhunter"" instead of the mess that was ""The Keep""? Well here it is.",9
2011-12-14,One of the best films of 2011. To say more would be to spoit it. Just watch it and enjoy it. Love the soundtrack also...,9
2012-02-02,"@CineStar SonyCenter, Berlin (OV)One of the finest actiondramas I have ever seen, fantastic directing by Nicolas Winding Refn and acting by Ryan Gosling. Looks and sounds great as well (wonderful score/soundtrack).",10
2011-12-23,Brilliant. The best film I have seen in a long time. Great sound track. Ryan Gosling is super cool. One of the best car chasing scenes ever.,9
,"Hm, acting was cool, but the movie completely lost me after the first half.",3
2011-09-17,"Pretty near a flawless film for me. It's honestly hard for me to find fault with much of anything. The relationships between the characters are great, particularly with Gosling and Mulligan (I think I'm in love with her) who say so much without even uttering a word of dialogue and the action is fantastic. I mean the opening sequence sets the tone for the entire film; a drive through the streets of LA with barely a word of dialogue, just‚Ä¶",10
2012-02-16,A _very_ pretty movie with beautiful light and depth of field.,6
2012-02-15,"An outstanding, stylish piece of work, Drive is one of the most compelling films I've seen in years. Violent, noirish, and suffused with a sense of 80s cool without ever seeming like a pastiche, the film is dominated by a superb performance from Ryan Gosling, whose nameless Driver is clearly indebted to, but bears comparison with, Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name. The pacing, plot and painstaking photography are all spot on, and best of all is the wonderful electronic score that flips between spaced-out ambience and thudding neo-electropop. An absolute treat on every level.",10
2012-01-26,"The cinematography is stunning, from the 'in-car' sequences to the lighting its gorgeous to look at. Audio-design is raw and vigorous, and the soundtrack and score are great. Gosling and Mulligan's performances are completely surpassed by Albert Brooks and Byran Cranston. Meanwhile the story is straight-forward and has some intense moments. It's definitely one of 2011's best, but some ""awkward"" pacing slightly ruins it.",8
,Gosling's driver is a curious mix of shy sweetness and dead-eyed psychosis. You wouldn't want to cut him up on a roundabout.,7
2012-02-14,"Nicolas Winding Refn has quickly become my favorite director over the last couple years, and Drive did not disappoint. Someone tweeted that this movie was basically a music video for Ryan Gosling's face. While there might be some truth to that, it's also an intense and suspenseful movie that's easily my favorite film of 2011.",9
,Great flick. Refn & Gosling at the top of their respective games. Top film of 2011.,10
,"An intelligently paced, stylistic action movie with a focus on characterization. The throwback to the 80s was great.",9
,"Watched this now 4 times. This is a film student's wet dream, beautifully lit, dark, ominous characterization, loud hipster soundtrack, heavy score, lots of gore.",9
,"The movie that boosted Gosling, a little romance between the violence and supported by a killer '80s electronica soundtrack.",8
,one of my new favorites. blows transporter etc out of the water. It's at a whole new level.,9
,"""buckle up because the dialogue in DRIVE is also minimal but all of the content and visuals pack enough punch to give anyone a severe case of whiplash""",9
2012-02-11,"Don‚Äôt watch this like me expecting a dizzying story with superb character development. Instead, watch this expecting a gritty and striking mood with thrilling and gripping performances from Ryan Gossling, Albert Brooks, Carey Mulligan, and the ever-dependable Walter White, er Bryan Cranston.",8
2011-10-12,Drive proves that 'style over substance' can sometimes be a good thing.,7
,Slow start. Several awkward interactions between characters. Second half of movie was much better. A few gory scenes not for the faint hearted.,7
,"what the fuck, for real?",1
2012-02-12,"The most discussed movie of the year, and with reason. This is only the second movie I've seen from Refn and again i was stunned. Not so much by the story, but the way every scene was visually brought to the screen is just amazing to say the least. The main character 'The Driver' is not a man of words but of deeds. Some of the staring contest scenes will prove so ;). Some will probably think the whole 'silent'‚Ä¶",9
,"Someone once said ""If you can't find at least something you like about this film, there is something wrong with you"". I believe that with all my heart.",10
2012-02-21,So ridiculously good. Extremely cool. Brilliant.,9
,"A modern day fairytale, Drive carefully balances cool retro-pastiche, captivating character studies and wince-worthy violence to present 100 minutes of cinematic gold.Clean visuals bring the gripping car chases and sporadic busts of aggressive action to life, but director Nicolas Winding Refn keeps the same attention on the more intimate moments.Backed up by a criminally cool soundtrack of 80s inspired melodies, Drive shifts modern film-making into top gear.",9
,"After all the hype, I was disappointed. I liked the idea and the atmosphere of the film, but it felt poorly executed. There were far too many holes and the contrast of good actors and bad actors made the bad acting really stand out.",6
,"Drive"" is, aesthetically speaking, an early Michael Mann movie.¬† It's a small doomed little character piece, with Ryan Gosling giving a great movie star performance, self-aware and stylized to an extreme.¬†",8
2012-01-18,Different but very tasty.,9
2012-02-11,Face-stompingly brilliant and great soundtrack. Gosling is perfect as the quietly smiling driver whose inner violent hero is let loose. Great sound editing as well eg the creak of Gosling's leather gloves,9
,"This is a very strong film that gets most of it's power from it's un-ending grip on atmosphere. Nick Winding-Refn really knows how to create mood, character and a very powerful atmospheric dirge like vibe (with the help of his brilliant composer Cliff Martinez). Ryan Gosling has easily entered the super-star zone with this role. He is simply fantastic and amazingly under-stated as ""Driver"". I love we never knew his name. Less is definitely MORE here as the NON-style morphs‚Ä¶",8
,"A movie very capable of stirring emotion. Some of the best use of music to enhance story that I've experienced in film. It enhances the dream-like state of the movie and helps create the feeling of a modern, improved version of the 80s, somehow captured on film. Plus, all of the driving scenes are exhilarating.",10
2012-01-31,Not enough words can describe how much I love this movie!,10
,Braindead action movie but not Oscar worthy in my opinion.,5
,"Underrated film but finally getting the accolades it deserves. Dark, thrilling story. Great cinematography & love the way it was shot. Sound track is also top notch.",8
,Definitely my favourite film of 2011. Can't believe it wasn't nominated for more oscars.,10
,"Another movie that I liked a lot more a few days after I saw it. Advertised totally wrong, however, this was a powerful drama beautifully shot and artfully choreographed. Ryan Goesling just proves that he can not say a word and still be amazing. Great cameo by Christina Hendricks as well.",7
,Best film of 2011. Came out of nowhere and blew me away. Film making at its best,10
2012-01-28,Dazzling neo-noir set in contemporary LA. Gosling and Mulligan are underplayed to perfection as doomed would-be lovers. Full review: tinyurl.com/7gtrbvj,10
2012-02-22,"The intro made me think of GTA Vice City. Maybe because of the music or the plain wrong fonttype they used for the credits :) I loved that game. I like this movie. Beautiful scenes and a stone cold Ryan Gosling: ""Do you want a toothpick?""...",8
,"Hard-hitting, smooth-flowing, ultra-cool thriller with a great 80s throwback feel.",8
,Best Film of 2011!!!,10
,"Intense, atmospheric, clever, extremely violent and simply fantastic. The sound track really made the film too",10
2011-09-17,"The relationships between all the characters were great, without having to spend much time on them. We could feel what was going on without even being told. I loved that Gosling's character was quiet and soft spoken, thinking and feeling without having to explain.",10
2012-02-10,"Love it. When I first saw this in the theater, I thought that everyone would love this movie. Then I heard someone walking out say that it was boring. That's when it hit me - I must be turning into a movie snob, because it never occurred to me that anyone would not like this movie. I then realized how slow, deliberate, and arty this film really was.",10
2011-10-11,Jesus wept! this is ... this is ... ehm ... no ... whhooooohoooo!!!,9
,"Ryan Rosling plays the loner with no name, a stunt driver working part time as a mechanic and as a getaway driver or vice versa. It's a film noir drenched in sunlight: Elegant, beautiful and ultra violent. Utterly compelling!",10
,"I thought of American History X mixed with Natural Born Killers when watching parts of this movie. Gosling is able to say plenty throughout the film without saying a word. I look forward to the sequel, ""Neutral.""",7
2012-02-10,"I've seen this film twice now. I missed it in theatres, which is a damn shame, because I REALLY enjoyed it. This is probably the best film of 2011 that I didn't see until 2012. :)",9
2012-01-31,"There's something about this movie that bugs me and I can't figure out what it is. Watch it twice you'll see things you didn't see the first time. Overall though the movies quite good, its very much a film makers film.",6
,"Sure, the soundtrack will make you want to rush out to buy some leather pants and throw a homoerotic 80s dance party, but then someone gets their face blown open and blood gushes out and you're all like, ""Dude, Joan Holloway is still sexy as trailer trash covered in chunky gore,"" and you know you have a problem. Was the popcorn laced with acid? Did someone slip you a mickey?",8
,"The sexiest film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is intriguing, melancholic, passionate, sweet, and raspy.Lots of action and bloody scenes.....(spoil) mind blowing kiss in the elevator.",10
,"awesome movie, with great soundtrack and actors",10
2011-09-20,"This isn‚Äôt a film, it‚Äôs a work of art. From the first shot you‚Äôre taken out of your boring life and plummeted into a world where everything looks fantastic. This film was made on a shoe string but you wouldn‚Äôt guess it. LA looks as glamorous as ever and this is heightened by the cacophonous soundtrack that fits perfectly. The opening chase sequence sets the scene, this film isn‚Äôt hanging around. It clocks in at around 90 minutes. The director‚Ä¶",10
2012-02-24,"While far too many films these days rehash the same concepts and premises in the same ways over and over again, Drive accomplishes the rare feat of taking story tropes that we think we are familiar with and blazes its own trail. Not to mention that every performance is aces. I could watch Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan stare at each other for hours.",10
,"Like a visceral modern redux of the Melville classic, Le Samourai, Drive is a bracing, contemplative thriller that flows poetically, and not like a series of mindless action setpieces. The film is expertly paced, thoughtful, incredibly well-acted, enthralling and intense. One of 2011's best, for sure.",10
,"Surprising, not the typical bloody-action story in the city of Los Angeles. I loved it, it's like it brought me to the 80's, especially with the awesome soundtrack. Excellent cast, acting, and sound editing. Very original to have involved the story of The Scorpion and the Frog, making you understand the Driver. I would say it was an extraordinary ride at the cinema. My favorite movie of 2011.",10
2012-02-24,"I have never liked Ryan Gosling more than I do now after watching this film. He brought a quiet power to the role that was so intriguing. Slow but very precise in all the best ways. It had me at the opening scene, I just wish there was a bit more like that beginning.",9
2012-02-24,"""Shane"" - horses + cars = ""Drive""",8
2012-02-26,"The treatment of this film was amazing. It's not for the faint-hearted. The cinematography, the direction, the lighting created such an intense atmosphere, it just heightened the whole experience. ",9
2012-02-26,"I thought this film was fantastic. Not what I (like most people) was expecting. In fact, two guys sitting near me got up and left about 10 min into the film. The trailer and the marketing make this film very misleading.",10
,"I love the director, but Ryan Gosling's character is so anoying, it ruined the film. he needed a slap",4
2012-02-25,So cool i nearly had a cine-gasm,9
2012-02-27,"Photography, understated emotive performances, sparse dialog and brutal violence all are plus in this film. It is very tense throughout; taught, not a roller-coaster ride of emotion. Yet the plot is a bit too simple. Good thing it is short, but it could've been shorter.",7
2012-02-25,"Every so often I get disillusioned with everything coming out of Hollywood. Luckily, every so often, something amazing like DRIVE comes along.",10
2012-02-24,"Um, yeah, ""Drive"" really isn't for me... I dont care that it is going after the style and feel of films like Michael Mann's ""Thief"" or that Gosling harnesses Steve McQueen's cool in ""Bullitt""... Everything about this just feels so fucking off... The obtrusive soundtrack, the awkward silences between Driver and Irene, Driver's incessant mumbling- it is all too achingly self aware and that affected my engagement negatively with this film. None of it feels like any fun and you‚Ä¶",5
2012-02-28,Odd love story I guess. Wonderful how the music and cinematography sets the tone. Loved it.,8
,I came to this film with zero expectation and came away pleasantly surprised. ,9
2012-02-17,"Danish Director, Nicolas Winding Refn is best known for his strangely stylised biopic of ‚ÄòProfessional inmate‚Äô Charles Bronson. ‚ÄòBronson‚Äô was the film which changed Tom Hardy‚Äôs film career & turned him from a bit-part player into ‚Äòbankable‚Äô leading man material.",9

2012-02-02,Well. I think I liked this less because I'd heard so much about it.,7
,"Neon Noir makes a comeback, one of the few 80's revivals that was worth having. Great film, director and star both reaching their full potential, can't wait to see what they do with Logan's Run.",8
,Essentially a perfect film.,10
2012-02-25,This was nothing like I expected which was why I enjoyed it so much. The long dialogue sparse scenes especially were something different and therefore enriched the movie. ,8
2012-01-29,I honestly didn't think I would enjoy this film but it has such interesting characters and so many different elements that make the film a roller coaster ride. It starts out as a high tension car chase scene which is told very cleverly. It then goes straight to an almost innocent love sequence between the Driver and his next door neighbor. Then the tension starts to rise again and because you care so much about the characters you can't help‚Ä¶,10
,Pleasantly surprised! Subtle acting and storytelling coupled with really stylish camera work. Reminds me of Tarantino without as many pop culture references. The soundtrack choices could be seen as cheesy but when thought of in the context of an 80s homage it works quite nicely.,7
2012-02-03,Best film of 2011...and Bizarro 1987,9
2011-09-25,"Probably the best surprise from 2011. Some may be turned off by its slow build up but that's one of the things that makes this so powerful. Everything can be so calm one mintue and the moment violence pops out of nowhere, it feels like some nightmare out of a David Cronenberg film. Nicholas Winding Refn creates one of the best films of the decade. Beautifully directed, body gyrating soundtrack, well acted (though Carey Mulligan seems miscast), pulse pounding action, and it has probably one of the best car chases to ever grace the screen.",10
2012-03-01,"Simple, slow paced and crafted to perfection by Nicolas Winding Refn. Loved it. Can't wait to watch it again.",10
,Ryan Gosling becomes an icon.Stone cold classic,10
,Gosling is great. Soundtrack also get 4.5 stars. must see,9
,"Nice soundtrack, but a somewhat thin story.",8
,Favourite film of 2011 from one of the most interesting directors working today.,10
,"Amazing movie, love the silent hero and the slow rhythm. The soundtrack is also fantastic and can't wait to read the book!",8
2011-10-20,"Moody, drifting, perfectly-scored and sporadically vicious tale of a psychotic getaway man who's far from being 'a real hero'.",9
,"I finally watched Drive in January. Whilst I enjoyed it, I didn't feel it lived up to all the hype. Yeah, that old problem. Still, it certainly has a style and pace all of its own.",8
2012-02-28,"What a knockout of a movie. Just moves like lightening but at a snail's pace. Such an understated, yet outrageous movie. I can't say enough about it. The violent yet operatic masterpiece with an amazing central performance by Gosling. Boggles the mind why it was ignored come award season.",10
2012-03-01,"Somewhat derivative of ""Thief"" in both story and tone, the director's slow, ""linger-on-the-scene"" style just barely works. The supporting cast makes this movie, in particular Bryan Cranston, and especially Albert Brooks, who should have gotten an Oscar nomination.",7
,"Engines ready? Then let Drive commence; mesmerizing beauty intertwined with moments of neon violence and adrenaline, Drive is quite possibly, the Film of the Year! Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, Drive features an intense and virtuous performance from Ryan Gosling, who captivates and fascinates with his menacing demeanour and compassionate charm. A full throttle trip, Drive is a haunting and beautiful joyride of nostalgia, reverbed in emotion and echoed with love.",
2012-02-25,"Wonderfully stylized film in which the Taxi Driver-esque feeling of automative solitude is combined with Tarantinoish intrigue and ultraviolence and the best soundtrack John Carpenter never made. Not much new here, but an Instant near-classic nonetheless.",10
2012-03-02,"Perhaps I should have seen it in the cinema, but I didn't feel immersed in this movie as I probably should have been. There's lots to like here, but the result came across as artificial to me. Pity.",6
,"Old-school meets new-school and the other way round. It was great at the cinema and on second viewing it's so much better. If you haven't seen it, just see it.",
2012-03-02,"A movie filled with long awkward pauses, and amazing visual affects. The entire movie feels like a cinematography art show that we are lucky enough to be apart of. The art style is crisp, sleek and cool with a color scheme that of Vice City even though this takes place in LA, though it is equally as mobbish. The story is solid enough and It truly is one hell of a ride no matter how clich√© it is to say that. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8
2012-03-03,Nicolas Winding Refn can do no wrong. Everything about the film seemed to be placed to perfection. Never thought I'd enjoy the light off a lighthouse so much.,10
,Great art house noir film. Great acting.,10
,A gripping thriller with style and coolness to spare.,10
,"Wasn't nuts about the story, but visually this is one hell of a movie.",8
2012-03-04,No surprise to those that have followed Nicolas Winding Refn's danish film carreer. He might be exactly what is needed in Hollywood right now. Drive is possibly the real anti-thesis to Quentin Tarantino's super-aestheticized films - the Antitino of stylized crime and violence. The important difference lies in the very real emotional impact. Near perfect filmmaking.,10
2012-03-04,Nicolas Winding Refn's amazing Drive. Sheer brilliance and a film which I'll be revisiting plenty over time! Ryan Gosling is phenomenal.,10
2011-10-07,"Digitally photographed crime thriller shot on location in L.A. Very atmospheric, in the manner of Michael Mann's COLLATERAL (2004). The lead characters don't talk a lot, but communicate via gestures, facial expressions, body movements. It's quite compelling for the first two thirds, but turns into standard crime show cliches towards the end, in the final confrontations with the two main villains. I wanted a little more imagination in the resolution. Worth seeing, but not as good as all the hype would have you believe. COLLATERAL is much better.",6
2012-02-10,"Not what I was expecting at all, but a million bazillion gillian times better.",10
2012-03-04,"I finally saw it on the big screen last night and although I knew exactly what was going to happen in every scene, it was an even more impressive experience than my first two viewings. If I could give it six stars, I would!",10
2012-03-04,"Finally got round to seeing this pretty fun, highly predictable, seeming homage to 70s/80s LA crime flicks. Gosling is mesmerising, everyone else, meh. Refn scores another highly stylised hit for me, but its no Bronson.",8
,"Ryan effin Gosling. The film itself is interesting enough, though I'm starting to believe that RG can only really play one type of character (SEXY but one-dimensional perfect man.... sigh) when there is even the hint of a romance in the storyline.",6
,Good. I'm enjoying refn's films so far.,8
,Great!,10
,One of the better flicks of 2011. Albert Brooks is mad dope as a cold blooded mob-boss...,8
,Not bad but not what the trailer promised,7
,Great film. Loved it. Spent days thinking about it afterwards. My most enjoyable movie for 2011,7
2012-03-02,High expectations can kill a film but not one that moves this quickly. Refn finds new beauty in neon-lit scenes of murder and horsepower driven adventure. More on the site.,10
,Loved the harsh contrast between the delicate relationship and the cruelty.,10
,"Soulless and sick. And not as in slang for cool. Though, stylistically, it is. Very. An expressionless Gosling is meant to be cool, too. He doesn't give a bad performance; in fact he hardly gives one at all. Anybody would, admittedly, appear bland opposite Cranston and (a quite phenomenal) Brooks. The largest problem is the gore, ostensibly there to communicate that Driver's nature prevents him from being with Irene. That his violence is unnecessarily glorified is just not cool. -¬Ω for the font.",7
,"NOT the masterpiece it's been made out to be, it's one of those films that's good because of the soundtrack and the atmospherics but when it comes to dialogue and script, meh!",7
,Film of 2011.,10
2012-02-08,"Perfectly fine, but the adulation this has received has actually turned me off this. Much like Bronson, it's a shiny, empty thing that slips from your grasp if you try and look at it for too long; it's also style over substance once removed: it references nothing but films, and filmic ideas.",5
,"Amazing. perfect score, and great pace. highly recommended",9
,One of the best films I saw in 2011.,10
,Absolutely loved it. Done.,9
,"pretty aggressive visuals which help set the tone of the movie, but are non the less, pretty vivid and heavy. the mood and subtle nuances of the film give it a unique and enticing appeal, not to mention a superb soundtrack",8
2012-01-30,"Who will give back my 100 minutes that I wasted on this movie? No one! This movie is hyped, everybody is enthusiastic about it, now it has come to German theatres... and I should've known! When people are writing about this ""own unique kind of excitement and thrill"" this movie builds up, there is only one way for it to turn out. ""Unique kind of thrill"" - I already saw this in ""Michael Clayton"" which had the same kind of thrill: none.",3
2012-03-06,"I hesitated to watch this film. Still, there was something appealing. I did not waste my time.",
,"Favourite film of 2011. Absolute perfection. Great cast, AMAZING soundtrack, surprises, brilliant acting, perfect editing. Love, love, love.",10
,My favorite film of 2012. Had no idea what a great character/performance I was in for.,10
,"As much as people I know talked up this film, I just don't get it. Or maybe I do. It was shot well and the majority of the performances were good...EXCEPT Ryan Gosling. Sorry, I can't accept this boy-man as a badass. And he seemed semi-narcoleptic throughout the whole film. Which is how I felt after watching his ""performance.""",4
2011-11-05,"The best film I saw in 2011 was, fittingly, a 2011 film. 'Drive' just doesn't force you to stare at its impossibly-beautiful shots and tap to its slick, pulsating soundtrack... No, it literally demands you to buckle up for your dear life - and the life of Irene and her ""Driver"" - or else you'll break through the windshield once this car begins to violently tumble down the hill.",10
,"Stunning film with a sensational 80's vibe. Gosling on fantastic form (man crush alert) with great co stars in Cranston and Brooks. Even if you don't like Drive, you'll come away with a need to own the soundtrack.",9
,"After revisiting this film a second time, I fell a little deeper in love with it. I wasn't so preoccupied by the music and stylized art work of every frame, nor was I as blind-sided at the drastic turns this movie and it's violence take. This time I was much more queued in, while challenging myself to decipher what makes this the great movie I believe it is. My first visit with the film, I felt it was pretty uneven‚Ä¶",8
2012-03-04,"Despite its early marketing and the lasting impressions it leaves with people, this is a film all about delicacy. It starts in predictably stylish manner but quickly cedes ground to a dreamy, almost mesmerizing portrait of a closely connected group of people, all longing for the quiet life.",8
2012-03-08,"If DRIVE was a person, we'd have a short passionate relationship which would end with me dead and/or DRIVE vanishing into thin air.",10
,"If you went to the theater expecting a mindless action movie, then you went at the wrong movie. ""Drive"" exemplifies what many movies should be doing; which is providing a stylistic rendition of what a Hollywood movie should be. The acting was superb and even though the emotions of ""Driver"" were well hidden at times; they were deeper that one might imagine. ""Drive"" is definitely on the top of my 2011 list, along with the powerful soundtrack which fits each scene perfectly.",10
,"Oozes style. Great cast, great performances, fantastic cinematography and an even better soundtrack. Gets violent, bring a towel.",8
2011-09-25,"Nicolas Winding Refn's tale of a getaway driver forced to take a stand when he's drawn into a situation involving mobsters, hit men, ex-cons and double crosses may not be the deepest film. There's no deep bond between a man and his favorite animal, Nazis don't show up, there are no terminal diseases or grant metaphorical understandings. That doesn't mean it's not a great film. As much as The Artist is a love letter to the silent film era or‚Ä¶",9
2012-03-04,"The idea of the Existential Driver / lone samurai warrior device is used to good effect in this film, and it's got Ron Perlman in it.",8
,"Plays like a slick, occasionally gory car commercial; stylishly directed, but Gosling's blank expression and stretches of silence left me wanting more. Albert Brooks deserved his accolades for his fine work, but Carey Mulligan was utterly wasted.",5
2012-03-08,"Slow, moody crime drama with a good soundtrack, kind of like a reincarnation of ""American Gigolo."" While it did have its rewards, I can't imagine ever returning to this one.",6
2012-03-05,"As they say a modern ""film noire"", nothing more, nothing less. Some scenes are a bit exaggerated, but the story is good.",9
,"Amazing film that I had zero knowledge of going on. Kind of surprised by the hyper-violent bits, but overall a pretty incredible storytelling experience, done a lovely slow, deliberate way.",9
2012-03-09,"Drive is a very clever and well made film. It sings of 80‚Äôs style and reeks of cool, but also has substance. It always feels like it‚Äôs playing it safe but in fact the conventions are being thrown away, the rulebook rewritten, every step of the way. The actors are all on fine form, especially when you consider how little dialogue they all have. The director gets the most credit though, for keeping the right balance of everything that this film is about while keeping it looking beautiful. My one criticism though, could have done with a lot more thrills.",8
,So good or maybe I should say I was won over by its coolness and 80s feel. I think the soundtrack made me forget that not much really happens.,8
,Breathtaking and stunning. Visually it is amazing due to fantastic cinematography. Definitely a film that showcases the director's talent but that doesn't imply that all actors involved don't give great solid performances. The sound is absolutely perfect throughout the film and the music fits the movie like a glove. Captivating and riviting it is definitely one of the best of the year. After a second viewing I will expand my review I'm sure.,9
,"There will not be a cooler movie released in 2011. No question. Nicolas Winding Refn's European sensibilities mixed with odes to American B-cinema is sloshed around to perfection here. It runs on a bare story and script, but ts substance is the myriad of styles its evoking: from the Euro colors, to the 80's type vibe in the soundtrack, to the indie type smiles and silences, to the B-movie love applied to cars and jackets, gory violence, and really bad‚Ä¶",10
,Ryan Gosling stares expressionlessly into space...,5
,"Not for the typical movie-goer, but this movie is a beautiful blend of the arthouse and action genres.",8
,By far one of the best movies released last year.,10
2012-03-11,"Quality film, Gosling is fantastic, the car chases are electric. Be warned though, this film is very violent, so not one for the squeamish!",9
,A beautiful movie with a wonderful soundtrack.,10
,Best Movie of 2011.,10
2012-03-02,its a good movie. i like that fact that ryan has a few lines,8
,My favorite film of 2011.,10
,"A artistic drama, action, suspense. Wonderful performance by all actors. Must see for every filmy.",7
,"Once you realize that you`re watching a drama rather than an action flick, Winding Refns stunning and hypnotizing camera work and the nostalgic 80s soundtrack really pull you in. Refn shows how you can craft an outstanding film from a rather dull and uninspired script. The few scenes of violence are very quick, dirty and incredibly gory. A must-watch if you liked Valhalla Rising. If you didn`t, stay away from Drive.",9
,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,2
2012-03-09,Already one of my favourite films of all time. Everything about this film just oozes cool.,10
,"What i liked about this is that if it was left to any old director it would of been a cliched and forgotten film, it's not that. What i didn't like about this film is it's basically soft music and Ryan Goslings silent face for about 90% of the time he's in shot.",6
,"Well rounded, great storytelling, and a great ride without driving you crazy. Who knew there were still heroes?",9
,"My favorite newer movie I've seen recently. The soundtrack is great too, works wonders for the vibe and feel of the whole film. I wish Christina Hendricks was in it more, but that's personal.",10
,"So, DRIVE. Everyone seemed to go bananas over this movie and it just didn't do anything for me. It didn't piss me off (other than the music) and I appreciated the performances (though I'm still very lukewarm on Ryan Gosling, despite having seen him in tons of stuff), but my response can basically be summed up in one word: Meh.",5
2012-02-24,Not a massive fan of Ryan Gosling but he is proper cool in this film. Enjoyed it immensley and cant recommend it high enough. Get the soundtrack and watch it again!!,10
2012-03-01,"Exciting movie, brilliant actors, fabulous OST.",10
,"Drive is one of 2011 best films. A stylish film with great soundtrack. Ryan Gosling is a excellent actor, at least in this film.",8
,Excellent film. Great soundtrack. Ryan Gosling = awesome. Carey Mulligan = lovely.,8
,"For the majority of its running time, Nicholas Winding Refn and Hossain Amini‚Äôs pared-down crime thriller features the purest kind of cinematic iconography, using classic elements from the past thirty years of movies to create their simple tale of a getaway driver doing the wrong thing to protect the wholesome girl. It‚Äôs a glorious painting done in primary colours, depicting a luminous LA in which our near-silent anti-hero ‚Äì a professional from the Michael Mann / Walter Hill school of‚Ä¶",8
2012-02-29,"An enjoyable movie, but it didn't blow me away in the same manner it apparently did some critics. The performances are spot on, especially Albert Brooks, who should have been recognized by the Academy for his performance. Ron Perlman, the best thing about so many movies, seems oddly miscast in this film. He's a little too larger than life in a movie that is about subtlety and small nuances. Still, well worth watching.",8
,"Stylish, beautiful & well scripted, Drive was easily the best film to come out of 2011. The art direction and cinematography are second to none. The soundtrack is implicitly good. The performances are strong, especially Ryan Gossling who shines through every scene. Everything about this film is note perfect. If you haven't watched it yet, put down your smart phone, get off your laptop, and do so. Now.",10
,"From making out in the rain to face stomping, I can't say this was the perfect role for Ryan Gosling.",8
,"Soundtrack, cinematography, acting, was just perfect. I thought this was going to be a racing movie but it completely proved me wrong the first few seconds with that low camera angle, i could never forget it. Gossling kicks such ass and he looks so fine doing it. If i could marry this film i would.",10
2012-03-13,"So sparse it's almost hard to take seriously (I assume that's why Ryan Gosling keeps smiling). Drive is a brilliantly constructed, evocative film, but a little overrated.",8
,The elevator sequence was jaw droppingly AWESOME!!!,8
2012-03-15,Two words....fucking amazing!!!,10
2012-03-16,"Loved this movie. Scarface, Transporter and Halloween all wrapped into one. Gosling has really come into his own to find good movies to be in.",9

,"Drive is a tremendous film full of top notch acting, great music and direction from one of the most interesting filmmakers about",10
,"Man was this movie a breath of fresh air! I loved this movie, Gosling was great in a sort of restrained way and with all the over the top villains seen in movies nowadays Albert Brooks was spectacular in his role.

Miles from home, alone in a faceless hotel room and inevitably pissed the film had a profound effect on me. It was eerie and compelling, an interesting, dreamlike mix of pregnant pauses and shocking violence. It probably wasn‚Äôt the best time for me to be watching it and I couldn‚Äôt decide if I liked it or not for a long time after. Strangely enough‚Ä¶",9
2011-09-25,Review incoming,8
,"Loved everything about it, especially the acting and music",9
,"Without a doubt the coolest film of last year, Gosling - ghostlike - moves through the film, righting wrongs, being A Real Hero, and...well, driving. Mulligan plays a fine supporting role as well, as the worried neighbour. ",9
2012-03-17,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,8
2012-03-17,First rewatch of this excellent film. I'm pleased to announce that everything in my first review that was after I saw it in theaters still holds true.,10
,"Call me gay for Ryan Gosling. The man can act. This finish dude can direct. The story is weird enough. And with the soundtrack, supporting cast, and dynamic forward moving editing and pacing, this film taunts the ""Transporter"" yet takes a turn to crazy Run Lola Runville and fast!!",8
2012-03-18,"Not a second wasted with this film. The film is so good that I almost can't sit back and enjoy the individual scenes without looking forward to the next amazing one. It's really an experience, a feeling, watching Drive.",10
,"An amazing film, on so many levels. The look, the soundtrack, the reserved acting and the sudden, sharp violence. A tragedy it didn't find a wider audience, which it should do on DVD. (or VHS!)",8
,Why has the film been ignored? I LOVE it!,10
,There aren't enough words in a billion languages that can describe how awesome this film is!,10
2012-03-18,"2 scenes near the end bug me, but this is still a good watch for a 3rd time. Made with a 70's aesthetic with a super Clint-like antihero performance by Gosling. It doesn't skimp on the red stuff either, pleasingly.",8
2012-03-18,Brilliant! Great music. Tension throughout. Extremely violent moments.,10
,My favourite film of 2011,10
2011-12-29,"Such a slow burning film, punctuated by shocking moments of violence. The opening ten minute sequence is more gripping than any action sequence I've seen in years.",9
2012-02-04,"Superior character-drive drama, stylishly directed with a wonderful performances all around. The staccato violence is chillingly effective, brutal in its presentation but restrained in its frequency. Gosling is understated, Brooks is calculated and cunning, while Cranston's performance is the true standout (and heart of the film).",9
2012-02-26,Loved it. However I cant help but not want to jump on the bandwagon so il be interested to watch it again in about 3 years to see how it holds up.,8
2012-03-09,"Stylishly shot, well acted great soundtrack. Not a massive amount of driving. Closer to Resevoir dogs than Senna!",7
,"Yes, the style sometimes overpowers the narrative, but you can't deny this is a film that dares to rise above clich√©s, and have some depth and actual desire to be something more. Plus that jacket!",9
,Best film of 2011.,10
,Wow! Well-done Ryan! I'm sure your character action-figure is in the making... much like Kill Bill's. Love the art direction!!,9
,Very well done. One of the best movies of 2011.,9
2011-12-10,"I don't know why I love this movie so much. Was it the Driver character, the magnificent score by Martinez, or the ultra-violence scenes that Refn brought. All I know that, all of it was mixed into one great cinematic experience. Thrilling, emotional, and wicked.",10
2012-03-20,"Very stylistic film with some great and beautiful shots. Gosling is surprisingly good. Dialogue was a bit awkward to watch, but that kinda was intentional.",8
,I am in a quandary about this film. I appreciate the artistic style and tone of it and the acting is quite superb but I am not totally sure where it was going with things. It all seemed slow paced and bitty. I watched it at the time with my wife and admit even I found some of the violence a bit much and would have thought you could have equal effect with cut aways and sound. ,6
,"This was a good movie. A little slow at times, but it reminded me of the car movies of the 70's",8

2012-03-06,"Slow burning character thriller that gets better every time you watch it. Drive is just one of those films that grows on you like an addiction, you watch it the first time you pass it along, then the second time you like it more, up until you've watched it the 10th time in a week and you're selling your body just for another hit...well maybe not that bad of an addiction, but you understand the metaphor.",8
,BAHAHAH this fucking worthless film. It could've been something but it wasn't. ,2
,"Hollywood stunt driver by day, getaway driver by night. Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive portrays the stoic anti-hero brought to life in a career defining role for Gosling in this retro homage to the anti hero movies of the seventies with echos of George Steven's Shane. Propped up with an excellent support cast. Driver is one of the more interesting studio movies to come out of Hollywood in recent years and has a lot to say for it's self, unlike most‚Ä¶",9
,"Ryan Gosling is, in my opinion, not only one of the most talented, but most intense young actors working today. His performance in DRIVE is nothing short of dramatic, as his lines are limited, but his acting is not.",9
,Grossly overrated. I had high hopes.,4
,"Another of my favourite films of last year that shoots Refn from self-indulgent arthouse director into a more mainstream arena. Not that that's always a good thing, but in Refn's case, it most definitely is. Also good to see Gosling branch out from romantic roles into something a bit more gritty, showing that he actually is a diverse actor.Best soundtrack of the decade.",9
,"In this extraordinary tense thriller, Ryan Gosling plays a getaway driver who becomes involved in a gangster revenge plot. The driver is an extremely introverted, quiet character, full of silent thoughts rather than loud macho guff. An unusual creative choice but highly effective. Some long, quiet scenes are punctuated with truly horrific acts of violence and action setpieces and the resulting movie is a virtual masterclass in rising tension, visual action, and brilliant character development. Awesome.",8

2012-03-23,"I was really keen to see this, but was kinda let down.",6
2012-03-26,Drive is a slow paced and subdued take on what would normally be a fast paced action film. Very interesting use of dialogue and shots give this film a very unique feel.,6

,"Another strong performance for Ryan Gosling in a B Movie, celebrating B Movies - an homage to a number of films going back to the 70's.",6
2012-03-24,"Beautifully shot; lethargically paced. Ryan Gosling is a quiet gent who works as a mechanic and does some stunt driving/crashing on the side. When he tries to help out the husband of the woman he's fallen for, things go wrong and his driving (and ability to violently murder people) is put to the test. Great cast (Albert Brooks is totally bad-ass) and a cool soundtrack help make this one a must see. Yeah I know its a slow movie, but dammit, it is a good one too!",8
2011-12-28,"I have watched this movie at least twenty times thats how quality I believe it is. Every time I watch it I notice something different about it. From the beautifully framed shots to the murderous transformation. This film is a thrill ride every time you see it. It's not a must watch, it's a must watch again.",10
2012-03-09,"The film has a super cool vibe to it, beautifully put together and matched by a great soundtrack featuring the likes of Kavinsky (Nightcall sounds like it was written for the film).",6
,Good: photography and music,7
,Such a well paced film. Gosling's best. The soundtrack takes it from a 4 to a 5 star for me. Powerful and engrossing.,10
2012-03-27,"I thought it would be like Driver, without the r. It wasn't. I didn't buy Gosling as existential hero or psychopath. He said too much and too little. The real hero/real human being song symptomised the superficial nature of the film. Tell me how to feel, why don't you?",5
,"An incredibly beautiful, slow-paced film, with great moments of tension and near-poetic violence.",8
,"Slick and sophisticated, but some scenes too violent for me",7
,I know I'm in a very small minority but I just did not see the appeal of this. Admittedly slick but with very minimal substance and no real reason to become invested in the Driver's cause (although I did enjoy Bryan Cranston's character),4

,"Really enjoyed this film on the whole, whilst the dialogue was a little on the quite side, the contrast between this and the moments of action and violence was fairly epic. Solid story and flowed well, although found the main character a little too withdrawn for such a sharp roll? Although not acted badly the character was in danger of appearing a little dim rather than just reserved.",8
,the best film of 2011. just as good 2nd time.,10
2012-03-29,"A lovely movie to watch while doing something else, for example talking to someone. Looks great, sounds great, acts great, not too much happening most of the time, not too much dialogue to pay attention to. Excellent! No, I'm not being sarcastic!",9

I was expecting some kind of low-grade action epic, but instead I got a stylish, slick, amazingly well played action-drama, with some truly memorable standout moments. No one is going to use the term ""high octane"" to describe Drive, but the words ""excellent"", ""cinematic"", ""gritty"" and ""stylish"" will turn up in abundance, and with the exception of some jarringly untalented strippers trying but failing to even be set dressing, this film has few flaws.",10

The only problem I had with the storyline was the lack of development in the main character. As much as I loved him and his personality, I felt there was meant to be a lot more on his stunt driving than there was.",8
,Good but not the revelation I had been repeatedly assured it would be (predictably). Cartoon violence a bit jarring.  Could have done with at least 20% more Carey Mulligan. This is true of all films/life situations.,7

,"Stunning thriller that manages to get a cool steel-like mood whilst also having a warmth that someone like Michael Mann seems unable to get. Gosling is great as a rather unlikely ""man with no name"" and all the supporting cast get it just right too. It's a very familiar story so all the surprises come from the direction rather than the plot. Would make great double with ""The Driver"" of which is seems a clear homage!",10

,Beautiful film. A master work of subtle nuance with a subdued performance by Ryan Gosling. It's tough arguing this one because anyone who says they didn't like it usually has a pretty well rounded well thought out reason why they did not. I think the slow pace and lack of dialogue really puts people off especially since this film is made in a way that modern audiences are not used to.

I am reminded of some of my favorite 80's thrillers like To Live and Die in L.A. and 52 Pickup when I watched this.

2012-05-11,"Very strange movie. Some emotional scenes at the start, before it disintegrates into a brutal bloodfest. Very shocking, graphic and disturbing, but for the most part an enjoyable film. Not what I expected, but still rather good.",7
2012-05-11,"I'm really not sure I could do this film justice, or say anything that hasn't been (more intelligently) already said. Brilliant soundtrack, really well acted, completely engaging. Watch. Now.",9
2011-09-22,"I just saw Drive (September 22, 2011), and I'm not quite sure how to categorize it. It's not an action movie. There are action sequences, but they are brief and not the meat of the film. It's not a character study or a drama, there just isn't much dialogue in the film and none of the characters are particularly fleshed out. In fact, the trailer probably contains half of all the dialogue Ryan Gosling's character has and I recommend you‚Ä¶",9
,Outstanding. I still listen to the soundtrack.,9
,"I didn't know what to expect when I first sat in my seat at the cinema when I went to watch Drive. But I can tell you now, I was absolutely blown away. I was hooked immediately by the great soundtrack. When the first bit of violence is introduced, it's about half way into the film. But when it hits you, it strikes you like a tonne of bricks. It's shocking, but fascinating at the same time. It's a great film, but so difficult to describe. The only way to recommend Drive to somebody is to tell them to ""just watch it"".",8

2012-05-12,"Wow is what I say after seeing this film, but whereas The Avengers was like a 'WOW THAT WAS AWESOME!' excited statement, this was more of a 'wow' because the film is understated. I'm surprised that it wasn't at least nominated for more Oscars. Got 'Real Hero' stuck in my head now too. One of those movies you want to watch again once it's over, it helps that it's only 96 minutes.",9
,Too cool for driving school,
2011-10-01,Good but its been waaayyy overhyped. More style than substance and it was just trying a little too hard to be cool. The synthy 80s music really suited the film. Some of the cityscape scenes with the music were very reminiscent of Blade Runner.,7

,"Ok, I thought this movie was horrible. However, I know people who loved it, which I find really odd - because the movie was just weird. There were several scenes where Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan just stare at each other for minutes without any dialogue. The movie starts out kind of good, but then the next hour it kind of drags on before finally there is some brutal death scenes. ",2
2012-04-15,"Awkward, contrived (e.g. soundtrack), capitalising on two trendy leads without giving them anything of substance to really sink their teeth into. The over-the-top violence and gore is a welcome reprieve in this otherwise flat and over-stylised film. That, coupled with the impossible-to-hate Carey Mulligan, warrants the one and a half stars from me.",3

The first half of this movie was infuriating that way. Somewhere in the middle, they dropped that act and started making an exciting movie where people talked to other people like normal human beings. This movie was surprisingly suspenseful and did a great job of making me care. Good job Ryan Gosling, for making me like you a little more.",7

2012-05-20,"My third viewing on Drive and my first outside of the cinema. The tension and quiet bits still grab my attention despite the call of Twitter and Facebook at my fingertips. It seems weird, for me, that a film made so recently managed to climb its way to the top spot of my favourite films list but there is nothing about this film that doesn't excite me.",10

2012-05-20,"The minimalism of Jean Pierre Melville jacketed inside the neon wash of vintage Michael Mann. The atmospherics created as a backdrop for deft character based performances, rather to set up violent set pieces. The energy of the film crackles just under the surface most of the time. The violence is tough and sudden in contrast with the ambient/techno/80s soundtrack. I wish I would have seen this in the theatre for which I think this movie was made. I am holding back on the final star because I am not sure if it holds up to repeat viewing.",8
2011-12-21,"I've watched Drive three times now, and I definantly know I prefer the first half of the film to the second half. The first half is quite dreamy and it's great trying to figure out Ryan Gosling's character. The second half is all a bit slap-dash and seems a little weak.",8

2012-05-28,Let me just start out by saying everything that was badass and enjoyable about this movie could've been handled in about 30 minutes. There was incredibly too much dead time and I'm not sure it was necessary to the film. Sure you need character and plot development... but really the unnecessary scenes didn't add that much to the movie.,6
2012-05-26,"I would given four stars, if not for the ""real human being, a real hero"" song repeating over the closing moments. Spread on a bit too thick, considering the rest of the film.",7
2012-01-28,"This is THE perfect film! Ryan Gosling stars in a calm Arthouse-Thriller and does his job so well, that he'd have deserved an Academy Award. But life isn't fair and so he didn't get one.

2012-06-12,"Boy, that escalated quickly.",8
2012-06-16,"This was a pretty good film I've been putting off for a while. It seemed like a big budget indie movie, if that makes any sense. It was sort of jarring to have a bit of the old ultra-violence come out of nowhere, but it worked well to tell the story of the character.",6
2012-06-14,"I really liked the way the violence in Drive was timed. There just wasn't any for a long time, and then BAM! you're hit with a scene. Then it continues it's non-violent streak, relying more on curt replies than anything. And then another brief, but very intense, violent scene. This was continued until the end of the movie. It felt very different and almost raw.",8
2012-06-15,Incredible movie. Ryan Goslings acting is superb and Nicolas Winding Refn really shines through in this movie.,9
2012-06-17,"In less capable hands Drive could have been very ordinary. Instead Nicolas Winding Refn takes this story and gives it an exquisite dream-like quality. Stunning visuals, great casting and phenomenal soundtrack all come together to make a classic. I expect Drive to be spoken about for a long time.",10
,"More ""Taxi Driver"" than ""Fast & Furious"", this portrait of a getaway stunt driver trying to do the right thing is broody, smart and shocking --when the violence comes, it comes hard, bloody and out of nowhere. Gosling is amazing, Brooks is even better.--M√°s ""Taxi Driver"" que ""R√°pido y Furioso"", este retrato de un conductor de Hollywood que adem√°s ayuda en robos es oscura, inteligente e impactante --cuando la violencia llega, llega duro, llena de sangre y de la nada. Gosling es genial, Brooks es a√∫n mejor.",9
,The most stylish film made in years. Gosling's silent Driver says more without dialogue than is normally imaginable. It has a lot of elements and they all stitch together seamlessly to create what can only be described as something special. The music alone makes this film worthwhile and yet it has everything else still going for it - including one of the best casts ever.,10
,"Now this is a film that needs to be watched at a time when u are feeling relaxed and u don't want to kick the b'jesus out of anybody near by. Gosling is a cold hearted, cool son of a bitch and plays his character with a sharp and chilling realism. The plot is slightly contrived but no matter as the pace is fast and the violence can only be rated as ooooooooooooof on the oofometre. Treffic watch!",9
,"Now that this is on Netflix, I've found myself watching this near five times in the last week. This film has been receiving a whole lot of mixed reviews, so I thought I'd throw my hat into the ring. A great ensemble for a bunch of shallow characters. Great lighting and cinematography are accompanied by an exhilarating soundtrack. Ryan Gosling is... Ryan Gosling (and I love him for that). The film provides great action that fades into subtle drama and then takes a complete 180 in a realm of hyper violence... my kind of action film. Definitely worth a watch.",8
2012-06-16,"Drive is such an exact dissection of the action movie hero it's almost startling. The unnamed hero wears an absurd but iconic and metaphorical jacket, and can usually be seen chewing on a toothpick. He almost never speaks. He's easily the most intelligent and capable person in the film, but he appears to be emotionally underdeveloped (that's perhaps not so odd, considering what he does for a living). Modern synthesizers underscore his every emotion. It's like he walked straight out‚Ä¶",9

2012-06-27,Loved the mood in this film. Visually stunning and at times extremely violent. Recommend it.,9
2012-06-24,This was a pretty intense movie. And a very different character for Ryan Gossling! It is nice to see he can be a versatile actor!,10
,"Easily my favorite movie of 2011. Was not what I expected it to be at all, but I ended up loving it anyway.",10
2012-06-24,"Despite my recent discovery, via The Ides of March, that Gosling's understated performance in Drive is less an acting choice and more his general state of being I still love this film. It's a case of a director picking an actor of limited range but one who perfectly embodies the part. It also has so much else going for it - great cinematography, a terrific retro score, Albert Brooks - that even if you remove Gosling from the equation it's still a magnificent piece of work.",10
,A perfect action movie. Excellent performances overall and dead perfect pacing.,10
2012-05-16,"Once I heard the buzz surrounding this movie, it quickly became a must see. I decided to read the book(which is rather short) before checking out the film, and for once having that background knowledge enhanced the film greatly. It is not for the faint of heart but the violence is done with such a finesse, and its a tour de force performance from Ryan Gosling. The author recently announced plans for a Drive 2 book, so one can only hope for another turn around the track in film as well.",10
,"I really don't understand what's cool and what's not. Case in point, that jacket. Personally I wouldn't be seen dead in something like that, but I've been told it's the epitome of cool.",8
,"well. I've seen it three times now. I read others' reviews of it and think, ""yeah, it's really artful...yeah...style....blah blah"". It's boring. I only watched it more than once because I was held hostage by co-workers who hadn't seen it. I feel so conflicted because I respect the film and think it really does have something special. However, I plead with all the gods above that I never have to watch it again.",3
2012-06-30,"It's probably fair to say that this is one of, if not THE best movie of 2011. Superbly acted by Gosling in the lead role and great direction from Nicolas Winding Refn. 'DRIVE is visually stunning and also has one of the coolest soundtracks in recent years. ",10
2011-10-03,Hands down my film of 2011. A modern classic.,10
2011-09-16,"The worst thing about Drive is the hideous, misuse of Mistral during the credits. You sit there, as Ryan Gosling drives into the night, wondering if you've been transported to a grittier version of Miami Vice. Maybe genre films remain an insular interest because the kitsch factor is too embedded in their culture? After all, this is the font that graced the intro of television's Night Court.",8
2012-06-23,Loved it. Looking forward to a re-watch soon.,8
,I know I am in the minority but I hated this movie. Had high hopes because the reviews were ridiculously good. This was ridiculously blah and just uninteresting and a waste of time.,2
2012-07-04,"Can see why this was top of a lot of critic 'best of 2011' lists, and also why not many people have seen it. Tense from the off, with amazing cinematography and a bubbling under current of feeling. Almost Kubrickian in the setup and style. Many will be put off by the fact that ""not a a lot actually happens"" and the almost wordless performance from Gosling, but hopefully will many more will soak up the atmosphere and enjoy this‚Ä¶",10
,"Not as good as everyone says. One of the most overrated films of last year but still quite expressive and impressive, just very sparingly. Gosling is average compared to Blue Valentine, and Carey Mulligan disappoints once more. Maybe I am missing something but the film as a whole had no emotional resonance and was not as enjoyable second time round. Visually nice in parts, just overall quite boring...",5
,"Stylish thriller that plays like Vanishing Point might if it were conceptualized by the bastard child of Sam Peckinpah and Michael Mann. Atmospheric and violent, with a Giorgio Moroder-ish soundtrack. First-rate, moody pulp.",8
2012-07-05,"Since I first saw this in the theater when it first came out, it still stands in my mind as one of the most surprising and unforgettable movie experiences I've had in not only a theater, but any film. Ever since the dvd first came out, I have seen this countless times but somehow, it still manages to be one of the best films I've ever seen everytime I see it.",10

2012-06-26,"This film started off great. Very exciting and thrilling. But then it turned into a violent gory killfest. If I want to see that I will watch a Tarantino film. I wish it would have focused more on the getaway driver aspect, dodging cops, driving the city etc...",6

2012-07-07,"The soundtrack is as good as everyone says! This movie is really tastefully shot and moves at a refreshingly unusual pace. This was originally going to be a blockbuster, but took a different direction when Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn took over. I'm glad he did, this movie infinitely more memorable than some throwaway blockbuster.",8
2012-07-07,A neon fever dream. Lots of staring and words never said interrupted by bouts of surreal violence and car porn.,10
,"If you're into blockbuster action movies, this isn't one. There's plenty of intense action, but this is a small film created by artists who love their craft. ",9
2012-07-08,"I feel like adding a quote, but this is not a very talkative movie. At least, the dialogue in it, is not what makes it so great. A very slow-paced movie, but with a great soundtrack, cinematography, acting. The whole deal.

2011-09-23,DRIVE is one of those hit or miss movies with a lot of people. You can really love it or hate it because of it's slow build and little dialogue in the beginning of the movie.

,The closest thing to a perfect movie I've seen in the past 10 or so years.,10

,"Officially described as an Art-house Action Drama Movie, 'Drive' is quite simply the most stylistic film to have been released in a long time. Full of intricate details that enable this film to stand out, 'Drive' could well be one of the most well made and engrossing movies to have been produced.

The sound track gets you going and the opening scene keeps you on the edge of your seat!",7
,"This film, above all else, is an acquired taste. With constantly changing shifts in tone, the unpredictability of Gosling as ""The Driver"", and the extremities of the violent acts committed in the film, some viewers may find the film hard to take in all at once. But underneath the few, but brutal scenes of violence, and deliberately slow pacing, there exists one of the smartest, well-crafted crime stories of the year, and as a film it evokes all the subdued fury of Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers.",8

Conversations between Ryan Gosling and his neighbor are subdued and languid, but in other scenes violence explodes in a sudden fury out of nowhere.

Ryan Gosling barely speaks and instead, just stares into the abyss whenever he can...

One of it's major strengths is it's ability to communicate the feelings of the characters utilising the atmospheric 80s style soundtrack and some nice cinematography instead of lots of rambly dialogue.

The enormous brutality and tranquility, the perfect soundtrack plus the endless depth of Ryan Gosling is very rare. For me one of the most enjoyable and interesting films of the last years.",10

,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I loved the directing, and the soundtrack, but everything else was lacking. Ryan Gosling continues to not really live up to his billing, the movie kind of drags along and then it ends, and it doesn't have the good sense to dull our minds with amazing driving scenes. The only thing it had going for it was its extreme violence, which didn't register as shocking so much as mundane.",4

,"Nicholas Winding Refn‚Äôs Drive is preoccupied with imagery. Everything about the film, from the Risky Business-esque font of the opening credits to the presence of Albert Brooks, consciously nods to the 1980s. Refn tries to create a particular ‚Äúlook‚Äù and he largely succeeds. The first 45 minutes of the film are icy, tense, and existential in a manner reminiscent of Michael Mann‚Äôs Thief and Walter Hill‚Äôs The Driver.

There is so much analysis material here (my favourite bit being the subtle similarities between Gosling's Driver and Travis Bickle), but as a stylish and cerebral action flick, it works on so many levels.

The 80's inspired synths gave it a real blast from the past feel.

,"Recalling the genesis of the film, Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn spoke about his first disastrous meeting with actor Ryan Gosling. Who at the time, was interested in having him direct the still gestating movie 'Drive' - based on a book of the same name by James Sallis. Just prior to the meeting Refn had taken ill with a fever, in the hope of alleviating the symptoms, he ingested a sizable quantity of pain medication, leaving him in his own‚Ä¶",10

2012-11-08,"Drive is the type of movie that lulls you into a zone of quiet comfort before kicking you square in the teeth with relentless aggression. Rarely are movies this cool and never are people cooler than Ryan Gosling as The Driver. He can say more with the twitch of his eyes and the snarl of his lips than many actors can do with dialogue. This movie is as stylish as they come and features not one, but two heart-stopping bursts of violence, one of which is juxtaposed with a soft, beautiful moment that makes it all the more glorious. Best film of 2011",9
,A great slow paced gritty film that takes us into the mind of stuntman during the day & a wheelman for hire by night. With it's Los Angeles skyline as a back drop this film does not disappoint. Its John Hughes with violence.,10

,"Being one of those rare movies that garnered accolades from critics this year, Drive kept me waiting long enough. I must accept that the wait was not as rewarding as I had expected it to be. It concluded in a split in the middle opinion of the film. While I loved it for its detached nonchalance and sheer simplicity, I felt that the rom-action flick seemed rather amateurishly made at times.",7
,"I can think of no other film that I avoided for so long, despite being lead by one of my favourite male actors. 'Drive? Pfft. It's just another film about quick getaways with silly showdown scenes.' It kills me to think I passed the opportunity to see this at the cinema. It kills me that for 19 years of my life, this film was not a part of it. Drive is, for me, one of the finest films ever made.‚Ä¶",10

I avoided all the Notebook-related-hype about Gosling, so this was my first Gosling film viewing. His performance in this film is comparable to De Niro's in ""Taxi Driver""!

,Excellent and stylistic action/drama film. Sort of blows its load right at the start as the first scene in the film is without a doubt the best. Driver is a fantastic protagonist mostly due to Ryan Gosling's minimalistic and delayed dialogue and emotions. He feels bottled up and it shows.

In fact, the real driving force of this film is the one-two combo of Sigel's photography and Cliff Martinez's pop-synth soundtrack. ",10

2013-05-17,This brilliant film is like a breath of fresh air. It was the best film of 2011 and it gets better after several re watches. There is a mood set by Drive that few films can achieve these days. It stirs up more emotion and suspense with as little action and dialogue as possible.

This is a movie that's all about atmosphere; from its synthpop/electronic soundtrack to the brutal violence, to the simple fact that Ryan Gosling really doesn't say much throughout the entirety of the film. It's an interesting experience. I don't think its the greatest thing to ever grace my screen, but It is undoubtedly a must-see movie.",8
2011-10-02,"I liked it but I wasn't crazy about it, I think it's very much style and not as much substance. Some of the characters are just too flat for me and lack the depth and substance that really brings them up to feel like actual people.

2012-02-29,"A decent attempt at mimicking '80s Michael Mann, and as such, there are worse ways to spend two hours. But the spare story and cast characters who all fall into one of two categories -- one note or blank slate -- provide a far-too-minimalist spine for the film, no matter how hard director Nicolas Winding Refn attempts to buff every frame into a hyper-stylized sheen. Also, Drive's most thrilling sequence, by a large margin, is the pre-title getaway. When your movie's best scene is its first, that's usually a problem.",6

A genuinely iconic actor creating a genuinely iconic character isn't something that happens every day; be thankful you were alive to see it happen this time.",10
2012-03-04,"The singular vision that this film possesses is something I admire more than I enjoy. The directorial technique that Winding Refn employs to both display and examine violence alternates between smart and thrilling to lazy and graphically dumb. At times the themes and tones that the director emphasizes exist at the consequences of compelling character arcs. The cast is lights out, especially Cranston, Brooks, and Gosling.",7

2013-07-22,"To keep it nice and simple on this review, Drive didn't work for me too well. Ryan Gosling is absolutely fantastic in the role of the unnamed driver but around him, there was a lot of quietness (which I understand is the director's attempt) but through this, I just felt that characters weren't necessarily fleshed out. I wasn't invested in most of the stuff the film had to offer but where the film truly saves a large deal of it‚Ä¶",5
,"Giving us a languid, gorgeous film which relies on minute facial tics and body language to convey the story, then suddenly splashes the screen with guts and gore, feels a cheap trick. The inner violence being unleashed is enough in and of itself. We understand. We don't need to be literally beat across the face with it.",9

I wasn't sure what to expect when i started it but heard good things, and the elevator scene where he literally stomps a guys head in was probably one of my favorite movie scenes, the deaths were decently graphic for a non-horror as well.

While it's a good movie, I honestly gotta say I found myself a little bored by the latter acts. It reminded me of The Powerpuff Girls movie. Slow buildup that turns into an orgy of violence. But unlike the PPG movie, Drive offers the viewer self reflection and questions about big whys and whats and how fars.",7

,"The film Drive reminded me of most is Stephen Soderbergh's Out of Sight. Not because they have anything at all in common in terms of story or style, mood or look. They don't. But because they are adaptations of fairly strong crime novels - in this case, of James Sallis' pared-down, hypnotically taut getaway-Noir story - which are elevated somewhat by directors with a thrilling sense of the cinematic.Even then, elevated may not be quite the right word. Drive‚Ä¶",8
2013-07-27,Mixed feelings after watching this one. The opening sequence is freakin' superb: such a strong start. Our introduction to both Gosling's and Cranston's characters is done deftly. ,6

2013-07-28,"My recent viewing of Only God Forgives prompted me to watch Drive again. While different from a lot of major blockbusters and thrillers, it still has a hero who is easy to root for, car chases, heists, and plenty of bloody violence. I liked it at least as much the second time around, and it looks fantastic on blu-ray. ",8
2013-07-28,"Still the full package. Style, suspense, a fantastic soundtrack, fascinating cinematography, action, heart, atmosphere, a streamlined and satisfying story, rhythmically choreographed violence, and, yes, a lead character with rich emotional depth. It's there if you look for it, mostly in Gosling's eyes, which reveal the ocean of feeling beneath the cold exterior, and the barest hints of a past that is probably scarier than we'd like to know about.",10

A theme that speaks to a lot of the lonely people out there.",10
2013-07-28,"I never read the book, but I really liked this film for what it was. The camerawork and soundtrack were sublime. I felt there was a lot of emphasis on the violence/action.

It‚Äôs like a postmodern Bullit heavily influenced by 80‚Äôs Michael Mann, Martin Scorsese and quite a large dash of Jean-Pierre Melville‚Äôs Le Samourai.

2013-08-06,Well written and directed movie which I liked quote a bit. Ryan Gosling makes a solid lead performance in a role which suits his acting style perfectly. Not a single expression too many as it should be.,9
,"A crime thriller that‚Äôs unoriginal as hell on paper, but is rendered completely original in execution thanks to the unique visuals and tonal style that Winding Refn employs, such as the frequent use of long takes and wide angles that can‚Äôt help but just suck you right into the frame.

The stripped down, archetypal 80's action film (which one of the characters was wont to produce) elements are part of wonderful homage to the genre. The commitment to the color scheme is subtle yet impressive in its own right.

Excellent directorial choices throughout, especially in the thrilling driving sequences. A bit less engaging for me in the final third, which felt like little more than tidying up which characters were living and dead. The minimalist approach to painting the characters' backgrounds and motivations further limited my empathetic response. Also, the scorpion motif didn't need to be spelled out quite so explicitly--we've seen The Crying Game. These quibbles aside, I'd still recommend Drive as an atypically meditative action flick.",8

The director and cinematographer did a fantastic job compromising the shots to have meaning. and i believe it had two different levels to it that made it better for me. The first layer being just the acting and the story, i found the acting to be great and the story was fun to see unfold and it was all enjoyable. But upon rewatching it i found it had lots of depth, the symbolism was really great and it helped boost the story. Also the soundtrack is amazing.",9

2013-12-22,Watching the film again has really made me just love the film even more. It's visual style is incredible without being overbearing. Plus the complexity it gives characters in what is in essence a simple plot is what I love the most. Knowing the power a simple look can say more than the longest dialogue scene. It makes me want to go back out and make my next film. I can't give higher praise to a film than saying it inspires me to make more myself.,10

2014-02-02,"Amazing... Everything matches very well: the noir atmosphere, the photography, Ryan Gosling, a cool soundtrack... It's worth watching.",10
,"Drive appears to have little CGI. Most of the stunt driving seems authentic, with cars of mass and heaviness, instead of ridiculous animated fantasies. The whole movie, actually, is incomparably more genuine than the typical action-crime-chase fabrications we've become bored with. Here's a movie with deference to writing, acting, technique and well-informed moviegoers. The crucial feeling you want to experience during a chase sequence is participation in its intent. You have to worry. Almost always nowadays, we're just watching fast machinery.",8
2014-02-04,"This movie keeps getting better. When I first watched it I saw it as an average film with an amazing opening scene. Now, it's a great movie with many brilliant scenes. I'm not sure how to describe its greatness but to say it's very suspenseful and wonderfully cast, edited and directed. And then there's the plot which is just the right amount of complex and paced just right. ",9
2014-02-09,"Stating that this film is a victory of style over substance is not a criticism and it has enough substance to be a decent movie, but my god-what style. ",10
,"I've always been on the fence about drive. I feel that it's many strengths are also it's very weaknesses. For ex. Ryan Gosling has an eeriness about himself in this movie that people seem drawn to. And I see why they feel that way, but It's also one of the biggest turn offs for me. I love Drive just as much as I hate it...",6
2014-02-09,Great movie. Nice to see Walter White again.,8
,"Beautifully shot, extremely stylized. The soundtrack moves the film forward and Gosling could not fit the stone cold part any better.",8
,"Watch it once, watch it twice, watch it again. Each time you watch this, you'll find something new and clever in it. Simple plot, tacky acting ( in a good way), and clever direction, this isn't the plain movie it appears to be.",7
2014-02-13,"The silence in this movie was almost overpowering, and for part of the movie I was kind of undecided about how I felt about that. However, thirty-five minutes in it all snapped together for me. This movie is the embodiment of masculinity as an archetype, which doesn't mean that it's a ""man"" movie, as a women can embody masculinity as well, but it does mean that this film is the ""strong silent"" type. This whole movie is a pitch perfect‚Ä¶",10
,"My thoughts on this film have changed on my third viewing, the first time I saw this I thought this was the best film every, it has amazing characters, it looks stunning and it was really enjoyable. I think its a great film still but in the last half an hour or so it just turned into blood and guts. I see why it when down that road but i feel like they could of taken a different approach to it, I wanted to see Ryan Gosling's relationship with Irene grow.",8
2014-02-15,"I initially thought this is a film about cars. or racing, or cars racing. You know, those movies populated with the din of screeching tires, and explosive car collisions. Stuff that I am not very fond of. But a friend (who is a budding Gosling groupie? Haha.) whose taste I trust, mentioned this movie. (Hi Meliza!) So I finally watched it and it was great.",9
,"‚ÄúI want to drive you through the night, down the hills,‚Äù croons the ethereally electronic duo Kavinsky and Lovefoxx in the opening track of the OMPS of Nicolas Winding Refn‚Äôs Drive. This enchanting tune highlights the events of Ryan Gosling‚Äôs unnamed protagonist, racing through a neon-soaked cityscape, his destination unknown to the viewer. Though this picture was created in 2011, it was definitely worth the rewatch, and if you have yet to see the film, checking it out should be‚Ä¶",8
2014-02-16,"What Hollywood says it is: (According to the marketing) A gripping action thriller featuring Ryan Gosling smashing people's heads in, shotgunning people through the chest and generally being awesome.",9
2014-02-16,"Waited nearly 3 years to watch this movie, having seen the trailer thinking it was about racing, shooting and cars flyin' to the moon. Tonight I finally watched it, and I was delighted.",7
2014-02-16,"This is not a movie that gives you a lot to work with, but it does not matter, you can go a long way putting any other movie's wrappings around it. For me, it came closest to a Spaghetti Western, complete with a man with no name (riding his mustang), the damsel in distress, the quiet, and the bursts of action.",8

2014-02-17,"Autistic Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Ron Pearlman, Albert Brooks....",8
2014-02-16,"One of my favorite films in recent years, that has restored my faith in modern movies reinventing and defining genres. A good question might be, what genre does this fall in? It's neo-noir, crime thriller, heist, revenge, romance, and art house picture all rolled up into a ninety minute film that plays like a stylistically violent dream. I was always a fan of Refen's work, especially Valhalla Rising, but with this film Refen was able to make a movie true‚Ä¶",10
2014-02-21,"Pretty solid film, although I think this film is pretty overrated. Two things really pulled me out of this film. The first was the sound. For what ever reason, in parts of the film, they put all the dialog and sound effects on the right channel and the music on the left. It creates a very strange effect. When there is a character on the right side of the screen, and you hear their voice on the left, it pulls‚Ä¶",8
2014-02-21,I'm not sure which of the two kicked more ass: the movie (and its sweet lighting) or the soundtrack. I honestly think it may be equal-parts ass-kickery.,8
2011-10-03,"Almost perfect. Gosling is becoming so damn good. Carey Mulligan didn‚Äôt have a huge amount of work to do, but she‚Äôs damn adorable. But just‚Ä¶ ugh‚Ä¶ the music, the mood, the eighties influences, the cast, the violence, the chases, that elevator scene which is right up there with my favourite cinema moments of the last ten years‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all such a glorious mess. Movie of the year so far.",10
,"A great film for the first two thirds, nice character interplay and slow building of narrative. Let down by the last third in which the retribution didn't lead anywhere.Visually rich.",7
,"For many months, buddies kept recommending me this movie, and I kept procrastinating it. Although it may not have been as great as I thought it was going to be, the style of the movie was enough to make me enjoy it in entirety. The soundtrack is fantastic, and when the movie picks up, it REALLY picks up. As a side note, I found the beginning to be perhaps one of the best intros to a movie.",7
,"In typical film noir fashion, Nicolas Winding Refn‚Äôs 2011 film, Drive, begins with the driver giving a monologue in a dark room. He is almost completely silhouetted and is looking out a window at the city of Los Angeles at night.",9
2014-02-26,There's a reason this film has two different reviews hailing it as 'brilliant' on the Blu-ray case alone - because it is. (Completely unlike my 'review' here.),10
2012-02-12,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,10
2014-03-02,"As of now, I've watched it around five times. Still nuanced as ever and Gosling is still my mancrush. Review is coming soon.",9
,Love this film,10
2014-03-03,"Ryan is pretty quiet in that movie. But that's okay, I would not talk a lot with you If you know what I mean.I like the 80s-touch of the soundtrack, even the voices and lyrics where kind of disgusting kitschy.",7
2014-03-04,I thought I would like this movie more than I did.....which is not to say I did not like it...but still,6
2014-03-08,"I found the theme and melancholia of this film had striking resemblance with Kim Jee-woon's A Bittersweet Life. You know, the coolest guy, a brief encounter with the pretty girl, lead to bloody revenge.Anyway what a film. If you love the music, I know I do. Go check Symmetry's Themes for an Imaginary Film. A two and a half hour instrumental project by Johnny Jewel, the original guy Winding Refn and Gosling wanted to do the score.",9
2014-03-07,"wow. this movie was an incredible watch. beautifully shot and directed, contemplative and surprising. there were times where the tension was almost tangible. would recommend to anyone.",9
2014-03-09,"After having Only God Forgives leave a sour taste in my mouth, I decided to go back to Refn's first film that I saw, the one that made me love him so much.To go back to the first pairing of Goslin and Refn.",10

2014-03-11,"A solid, enjoyable movie. Just a bit tooooo muuuuch sloooow moootiooon for me, but it doesn't effect the overall quality of the film.",7
2011-09-16,"Worked exceptionally well for me on two fronts: the terse late 70's male-driven brusqueness interwoven with a twenty-first century affected aesthetic: a near neon driven, Wong Kar-wai vision of Los Angeles where the city's nightfall becomes a symmetrical balance of urban expressionism, mixed with the gamesmanship of a genre veteran - something definitively anachronistic compared to the concurrently stripped down mis-en-scene of Walter Hill, but evocative of the old school's best moments, particularly the opening scene. Then it starts to‚Ä¶",8
2013-01-23,"Incredible film with Gosling showing why he is one of film's hottest properties right now. His portrayal as a sensitive individual with a mean dark side is perfectly played. His awkward charm is juxtaposed by his visceral temper. Astounding!Carey Mulligan brings a delicate awkwardness to her role which dovetails well with Gosling's quasi-pyscho nature. Although she is mainly in the background, her character is integral to the emotional development of Gosling's character.This is up there with Pulp Fiction‚Ä¶",10
,"The entirety of Drive is a heighten, a moment where something you know and understand suddenly develops, complicates, expands, intensifies. The thing you know is film style, and what Nicholas Winding Refn does with it is dilate it so that each movement is expressive, every silence full of import. It's the neat trick of making a minimalist picture so precise it suggests untold depths and latent emotions. Mulligan, Cranston, and Brooks are especially good as the supports who cast enough‚Ä¶",9
2013-08-03,This is far and away my favourite Nicolas Winding Refn film. It takes the best elements of Refn's previous films and combines them with a bizarre new retro-synth soundtrack that produces some weird kind of alchemy. The upshot is that Drive subverts the 'action hero' trope with an ambiguously creepy/sweet romance and lashings of intense violence. All the while the film is utterly beautiful to watch and the simple plot is gripping and effective.,10
2014-02-21,"Drive is an exercise in style over substance, with blank characters lost in overlong stares and silences, dropped into a narrative that seems like an afterthought. But executed with the atmosphere, tension, and visual inventiveness Nicolas Winding Refn displays here? I could care less. A completely rapturous experience, with countless motion that can be considered pure cinematic perfection.",9
2014-03-15,Every time I watch this I want to drive a sleek fast car downtown at night with my shades on just after it rains so the neon reflects on the streets with 80's synthpop loud on the stereo.,10
,"It starts a little bit slow, but later on becomes in one of the most interesting action films I have ever seen. Violent, shocking, a little bit of cheesiness and romance, but is worth the watch. A cult film.",8
,Best movie along with TDKR,
,"Brutal film. Pretty mesmerizing, as well. 'Drive' has a simplicity that is rarely found in films these days. There is also a sort of quiet about it, too...maybe due to the fact that the titular character has such limited dialog. Ironically, I also feel that the soundtrack adds to the quietness of the film, probably because of its use of more subtle songs as opposed to something more pulse-pounding.",8
,One of my all time favorite films,10
2014-03-19,"""My hands are a little dirty.So are mine.""A mysterious, action based thriller film as a Hollywood stuntman preforms as a getaway man. Coming from a disreputable past, he falls in love with one of his neighbors in his apartment building. A true love story followed with great action scenes and intense emotions. ",9
2011-09-24,"In probably the bloodiest chick flick yet, Ryan G. refines his Blue Valentine character to its uncut, unselfish essence: a personal Jesus to a woman & the child she had by some absent asshole. His devotion ascends to hallucinatory levels, cemented by two dates & a slo-mo kiss, consummated by raging fugues of justifiable homicide. Nobody says much. You have to trust their beaming faces that this was all for the best.",6
2014-03-25,"So like this is the best movie ever made yo. Ryan ""The Goose"" Gosling is like totally bad ass and a bro who like also gets the chicks. He like also drives a bad ass car too which is like so cool because I do too like totally. This movie is the fucking shit nigga and like all yall motha fuckas better watch this shit or I'm gonna come over to your house and beat the shit out of you in front of your girlfriend.",10
2014-03-26,"I could NOT care less for anything that happened in this movie, who lived or died or got rammed with a car or stabbed with a fork in the eye. who gives a shiiiiit. who fucking holds a conversation with ten billion second pauses",2
2014-03-26,"After finally getting around to seeing this, there was a lot here that i wasn't expecting.",8
2014-03-26,"Funny thing is, Drive was one of those films that introduced me to the world of art-house cinema, where great stories are told and characters are crafted. Since I saw the film in 2011, I have been waiting to return to it when I felt ready. I didn't feel that I experienced it fully with my naive knowledge. Today, I was ready; and it is easily one of the glorious, nasty, and simply stunning films that I have ever laid‚Ä¶",10
,"I remember listening to a review on NPR about this movie and all the excessive ""violence"" in it. After it was over I felt like Nelson Muntz after he left a movie theater that was showing Naked Lunch. He looks back at the marquee and says ""there are two things wrong with that title."" There are actually a lot of things wrong with the movie, but mostly it was a tired plot line (think any Jason Statham movie) without the violence. Somone told Ryan Gosling he could give up acting in interesting movies and become the next action hero. Boring!",4
,Excellent beats and style of a rather gory story of an antihero. Sticks with you.,8
2014-03-30,"Awesome driving, fabulous electro score and great to see Bryan Cranston. A tad violent in places.",7
,"A great throwback to the crime thrillers of the 60s and 70s (Eastwood/McQueen), with the eclectic style of Refn thrown in.",9
,"When it ends, you don't ask yourself what happened to The Driver, you feel completely at ease, even after the whole plot. Its one of the few films that has a perfect ending.",10

2014-04-05,"Drive is an amazing movie. It's 1:30 in the morning and I want to watch it again. I'll go on to bed, but I'm sure I'll dream of cars, scorpions, and blood, all to a pulsing synth sound that makes me feel like a real human being... and a real hero.",10
2014-04-09,"More than anything else, Drive marks the titular ""marriage"" of Winding-Refn and Gosling.A combination of darkened mood and film noir-like picture resembling a modern-retro art satisfies eyes that worship art and Gosling. Visually mesmerizing and beautifully brutal... it's a pioneering pawn of pop culture.",9
,"Drive is one of those movies I think everyone should see. There's action, romance, violence, and Ryan Gosling. Why not see this film, right?Yeah, it's not your typical action movie in the way it's presented. There are not explosions every five minutes and it's not fast paced. This film is very much driven by imagery. And it's for the best. I believe it pays off well in the end. Though the characters don't say much, you're just pulled in by‚Ä¶",9

That aside it is a fantastic film about a driver who aides in a heist but something goes wrong and he sets out to get back at the guys who set him up.

2012-02-29,"DRIVE is a mesmerizing, artsy, bold, creative, epic, stylish, crafty and HIGHLY entertaining film, it reminded me why I LOVE cinema. The film gripped me from the incredibly tense and VERY well shot opening scene till the end credits and it NEVER lets down. Ryan Gosling gives a calm but powerful performance as Driver, a guy who does stunt work for the movies and at night drives getaway cars for small heists for extra money. His movie manager is Shannon‚Ä¶",9

2014-04-25,"Drive is a bit of an odd beast. It tries to have all the trappings of the 80's, but the camerawork and tone are much more modern. From the first synthesizer notes on the soundtrack and the first credit on the screen, this film declares itself as a child of the 80's. There's ultraviolence on the screen, the hero is a part-time stuntman, and there is a desperate quest for vengeance. Someone more schooled than I can make a better‚Ä¶",8
2014-04-26,"This is possibly one of the most gorgeous films I've seen. The cinematography is so incredible, I was lost in what was less of a film, and more a piece of art.

2014-05-11,Slight decrease in rating. Still enjoy the film quite a bit though. On this viewing I finally noticed some horror influence which was interesting to discover.

I didn't even attempt to catch it theatrically because honestly, I didn't know anything about it and I incorrectly assumed that it would be a film focused on car racing, like the horrendous misfire Need for Speed that was released earlier this year.

It instills us with the motivation to tackle life's basic challenges every day but it also fills us with meaning and purpose for everything we do.

It's about both the dignified quiet beauty in silent moments alone staring into the eyes of the person you love, and the abject brutality‚Ä¶",10
,"I don't get why this film is so beloved. It's nicely shot, and the acting is fine - but the lack of story and my lack of love for cars left me bored quite frankly. It feels a bit like an emperor's new clothes type of film. All hype, no content.",5
2014-06-05,I honestly wonder the film would have been like with a different score because it sets the mood perfectly in this film. The soundtrack also feels very much LA does from my brief visit.

There was so much stillness that I had to check the lil timer on the DVD player to make sure it was still playing (which has been an issue in the past with this player).It wasn't what I was expecting, especially with how polarized the opinions on it seem to be.

It's also a throwback to William Friedkin's To Live and Die in LA & Walter Hill's The Driver. These are some films where the vibe of a scene isn't necessarily real- but cool as fuck. What really makes Drive stand out is the marriage of violence, character, & music. Nicolas Winding Refn's work behind the camera is startling, with him catching the neon grit of LA,‚Ä¶",10

Drive's eighties aesthetic and sensibilities are an integral part of its overall success, and without Cliff Martinez's score it doesn't really work.

They make up more than half of the film's appeal in my opinion. Even though Drive's taste is derivative of a lot of genres and styles, it's a golden boy to mix them to make it a poster boy for the state of cinema in the 2010s.",10

The pacing is incredible, accelerating from a casual meander to an explosive tempo, not unlike the incredible driving skills of the un-named protagonist. The camera work is brilliant - Ryan Gosling is a brooding menace, swinging from perceived casual indifference to hyper-violent. Does he know where this is going? Does he care? Is he along for the ride as much as we are? The film is bolstered by it's wondrous synth-wave soundtrack that bleeds emotion into each and every scene. A wonderful piece of cinema",10

2015-01-16,"It really struck me that Drive is a top contender to be the ultimate spiritual successor to Goodfellas. They both tell an immaculately stylized story of the criminal underworld at the time. While Scorsese focused on the downfall of the east-coast mob, I feel like Refn really hit the nail on the head by looking at the lone-wolf mentality of being involved in organized crime in the 2010s.

,"A beautifully made film where everything just comes together wonderfully. The combination of the exceptional soundtrack and striking visuals works brilliantly, and Refn's alternation of scenes of great beauty and of great violence works splendidly. I also found the timing and editing of the film really intriguing, particularly in crafting Gosling's Driver as a really unique character. This film is just a delight to the senses, and something I'll revisit over and over.",8
2013-05-31,"By painting a convincing portrait of the 80s with a contemporary backdrop, Winding Refn has directed what is undeniably the best film of his arguably hit-and-miss career. The combination of the soundtrack, the neon-acidwash vision, and the ultraviolence all aid in making it feel like the perfect homage to the era. Gosling is brilliant, but this is Brooks‚Äô show; playing a character like none he has played before, Brooks brings his best Lex Luther impersonation to Gosling's wannabe Clark Kent. Watching it is like looking into the past via a dreamy synth-pop video filter.",

His characters usually aren't very talkative, that's because he moved to the US from Sweden, when he was a child. Unable to speak English, he stated talking less. He is also color blind and has problems differentiating shades of colors, which is why he likes using neon colors, which he can tell apart‚Ä¶",10

Not all action movies are the same; not all have an exciting tone. Drive is somber, dark and somewhere soothing if you think of it. So, don't be mistaken if someone says it isn't action. It definitely IS, just without the escapist tone and blockbuster feel. It's how a real, grounded actioner would feel. If someone still disagrees, they don't get the action genre at all.",8

Ryan Gosling is pure magic. He turns everything he touches into gold (except for Only God Forgives, that was a bit too weird). Gosling is my man crush and I'd watch any movie he stars in.

,"Quickie Review¬†If there's ever a movie that made 80s style in pop culture cool again, not to mention a resurgence in neo-noir, it's Nicholas Winding Refn's modern crime classic.

Not since ""The Driver"" or ""Thief"" has there been a satisfying ride quite like this.",10

2014-10-30,"There's some artistic merit to what Zane Lowe has attempted to do with his rescore, but he's done it with absolutely the wrong film. Drive's eighties aesthetic and sensibilities are an integral part of its overall success, and without Cliff Martinez's score it doesn't really work. The original soundtrack has a near-ethereal quality that washes over the audience and blends beautifully with the hyper-violence on the screen. Lowe's, by contrast, feels intrusive and much too carefully constructed.",10

I dig this movie's style but I felt like some of the sequences with music are a little bloated and kind of feel like pointless little music videos. Additionally the portagonist's silent badass shtick can sometimes lead to awkward exchanges, especially with his love interest.

2020-07-03,Sometimes it's a struggle to talk about films you love because it comes across as hyperbolic gushing. It seems hard to be fair or recognize moments that aren't so great. Drive came out at the right time for me when I realized just how art can affect people like really affect people.

With the American muscle car being an important part to the way you deliver a movie it's like you have a certain pedestal to live up to.

2020-03-24,"An impressive visual treat and an engaging slow burn of a plot that explodes in its second half with eye opening violent consequences. A mostly quiet getaway driver in Los Angeles, played by Ryan Gosling, finds a connection with his neighbor Irene, played by Carey Mulligan. But when her estranged husband Bernie played by Oscar Isaac gets out of prison, the Driver's devotion to his neighbors is tested when his criminal connections threaten his life.",9
2020-03-15,"Was just talking to a friend about this the other day, and considering I just watched The Ne√≥n Demon a few days ago, I figured now would be the perfect time to re-visit Drive after so long. And as it turns out, that wasn‚Äôt a bad decision at all.",9
2020-03-14,"Drive, the movie is honestly a masterpiece and a half. The movie's got a brilliant plot, brilliant acting and some brilliant dialogue from all the characters throughout this movie.",10

2019-12-29,"Amazing film. I would say it particularly excels at tone and atmosphere, which the entire film is drenched in. The soundtrack is one of the all-time greats and only adds to the aforementioned tone. These aren't the only good qualities, however. Ryan Gosling delivers a career-best performance, the cinematography, colors, direction, and pacing are all excellent. I think about this film a lot and for good reason. It's beautiful, serene, unique and not easily forgotten. Certainly one of the best films of the 2010s.",9
2019-12-13,if ryan gosling looked at me like that i would have no problem with him brutally murdering people,9

2019-11-25,"Reviewing¬†Drive,¬†the great Roger Ebert writes that ""Carrey Mulligan is the template for vulnerability"". She's the best, and so is Ryan Gosling. He's made my year end list of top movie characters two years in a row, and this one he'll make it in my year end top movie moments. If Mulligan is quiet fragility, Gosling is solemn nostalgia. I once wrote that no actor does dejected misery better than he does (sorry, Joaquin Phoenix), and the performance he delivers in¬†Drive¬†is‚Ä¶",8
2019-11-23,"What many people might see as shallow, I see as poetic and layered. Especially with the driver. He may come off as an emotionless robot but there‚Äôs so many layers to his character. It‚Äôs the story of a real life Pinocchio, a real life fairy tale, a real human bean.",10
2019-11-17,"Ryan Goslin is THE man. Hes such a great actor, and this movie definitely shows off a lot of his talent. And the story was absolutely great and gripping, I never got bored once suprisingly. Also that soundtrack was perfectly done.",9
2019-11-17,"Gave this a spin on my new TV and holy hot damn it looks good. Not only that, but I watched it with the folks and they really dug it. Mom thought Ryan Gosling was ‚Äúpretty‚Äù and Dad was startled by Albert Brooks not having eyebrows.",10
2019-11-06,"watched this as a double feature w baby driver for white-boys-who-drive-cars-to-funky-music and this is a good study for how nearly identical stories can be told in drastically different ways. with both being kinda clunky and phonetically inconsistent, i don‚Äôt much prefer one over the other in this case.",6

Initially I found myself making comparisons to Baby Driver (another movie about a getaway driver, which I also love), but that comparison almost immediately changed to a more fitting¬†Nightcrawler or Zodiac-centric (...yes, even more movies I love) analysis, due to both its setting and atmosphere.

2019-04-05,"the last time i saw this was eight years ago when it was first released and almost immediately became a meme all over the internet - i was a freshman in high school and ""real human bean"" jokes were everywhere. i kind of put off ever rewatching it for eight years because of those memes and how much they eventually annoyed me? decided somewhat out of the blue to revisit and to my shock and delight this movie still fucking Rips despite all of that. richness in every frame. an absolute pleasure",10
2019-03-27,"Slick, stylish and super-cool, NWR‚Äôs Drive is a neon-soaked adrenaline ride with a killer soundtrack, superb cinematography and a stand-out performance from Gosling, an actor who can deliver childlike vulnerability and mete out bone-crunching violence, often within the same scene.",8
2019-03-23,It's comforting knowing sometime soon we'll be getting some brand spanking new NWR. Though that's not why I popped this bad boy on; it's just been many years. So many wise choices in terms of those visuals. Iconography that's fueled fan art since release. There was an odd level of respect given to each character. None of them feel tossed as a foil; each has their own personal stakes. ,9
,I worked at a movie theater when this came out and we had all these sweet people who were misled by the trailer and then tried to get refunds because they thought it was gonna be the fast & the furious. I sat down and watched it one time in an empty theater at like 11am and it just..... aaaaa aaa.......,10
2019-02-08,the atmosphere of this movie is great but idk i might need a rewatch,7
2018-08-06,"The beginning of this is one of the most realistic getaway scenes I've ever seen. Everything about this movie screams perfection and I can't get enough of the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan. This has very minimal dialogue, but Nicholas Winding Refn shows us that you don't need dialogue to show stunning character development. Very stylistic movie and great soundtrack, I'm sure this will be known as a classic years from now.",9
2018-07-16,wow you guys i actually enjoyed a car movie,8
2018-07-15,"This was only my second viewing but I still believe this was done about as perfectly as possible. No big shoot outs, no epic car chase scenes, no slow motion fight scenes, just atmosphere. The characters, the music, the tension, the slow build, it all blends together perfectly and makes for a small, simple and effective story. It looks nice, Ryan Gosling is fantastic, everybody is pretty good honestly, the atmosphere is real and the investment in these characters is‚Ä¶",9

Not to mention the fact that he basically just drives around California so I‚Äôm wondering if that counts. Also, there‚Äôs a family that‚Äôs apart of this film.

2024-06-02,Loved this from the second it started till the second it finished. Ryan Gosling has so much range I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever come across a bad performance by him. This is definitely my favourite role of his and they couldn‚Äôt have cast it any better. I would‚Äôve preferred a more tragic ending but that‚Äôs just my melancholy taste.,10

2024-05-31,"Refn has yet to top this, a glamorous but dark California neo-noir that transcribes Michael Mann/William Friedkin 80s crime vibes into a new century, with the focus on massive coolness. Everything works with critical efficiency; the actors, the cinematography, the music, the vibe. It‚Äôs all about the vibe here, the dream-like flow that takes you straight down into a nightmare before you know what‚Äôs going on. That‚Äôs the beauty of it. High art, if you ask me.

Throughout the film, the soundtrack effectively captured the essence of each moment, with long, awkward pauses of silence that evoked strong emotions from the characters. The raw energy that made this an action thriller brought the story to life without becoming excessive. It was just enough to keep you wanting more.",10

2024-05-25,"This is a purely emotional movie for me. Refn, after his Copenhagen films, developed a high contrast, vibrant style where sound design carries all the weight. I see people complaining about the ""Under Your Spell"" scene, because it's bad that an audio-visual medium uses music and actor's faces to convey the thoughts in a character's head rather than them ""cleverly"" dictating to the audience. It's funny this at one time was considered pretentious because it's actually a very earnest and straightforward narrative.",10

NWR makes expressionist action films where the characters exist in such a neo-reality that their actions are just pure emotion expressed.

In that way, exploitation film violence in a somber and deep character movie",10

The idea of not having the main character use a name outside of ‚Äúthe driver‚Äù is such a great direction choice as it leads to mystery even after the film is over. What was thought to be an action movie, was kinda swayed slightly due to the opening act more so being a romance story. Choice of music was phenomenal along with the acting, I for sure will 100% be watching this film at least a good few times.",10

2023-01-14,It‚Äôs always risky to cast a neurotypical actor in the role of a ¬†neurodivergent character. In this case it seems to have worked but only because the awkward gaps in conversation and the abnormally long eye contact was misinterpreted by viewers as some sort of dreamy unspoken love progression. ¬†The musical score was brilliant.

I would like and maybe even come back to this film for a laugh if it wasn't so critically acclaimed. The fact that it is makes me so mad, I hate it.",2

2022-01-17,this is not a good movie. girl neighbor ¬†of course had no personality besides enjoying going on car rides and cheating. This movie is like what new girl is for boring girls who want to feel a little special.

2021-12-29,This movie lowkey sucks ass. Ryan gosling isn‚Äôt even that hot. He comes across as a weirdo with no social skills in this movie and his jacket is tacky. The movie is not nearly violent enough. I also don‚Äôt really like vapor wave music. The real human being song was awful. Bryan Cranston was my favorite part of this movie.,2

2021-10-17,Aggressively slow to the point that I completely switched off and then tuned back in to wanton violence of some description on several occasions with no idea how we got there.

,from ryan gosling's domineering puppy eyes to his infuriating yet endearing shit eating grin drive demonstrates that even with generic acting a film can be carried through its writing cinematography and direction. nicolas wind and rain manages to pace the film engagingly while setting a delicate balance between slow emotional and fast-paced action yet despite his best efforts at crafting a cinematic and poignant classic drive ultimately falls short of steve job's best work and ultimate legacy the masterpiece from pixar Ratatouille,2

Anyways, I'll be generous and give this movie 2 stars.",2
,"I'm so tired of Ryan Gosling. Kurt Russel may have successfully graduated from the House of Mouse to legit badass, but Gosling still reeks of Disney saccharine.

2023-06-28,Disappointing. They had a great cast but they wasted their potential due to a shit script. Gosling barely had any lines it came to the point where I thought it was because of a budgeting issue. Pacing was slow and I wish we saw more of what Gosling did before meeting Mulligan. The soundtrack was also jarring and felt out of place. There was promise in the trailer so it was disappointing for the story to be ultimately about a simp‚Äôs plan that goes wrong,3

2020-09-08,some kid from school recommended me this lol i didnt really like it. most of it was really boring and the few good scenes werent enough to make up from the lack of ? plot ? character depth? anything that would have made this movie more interesting? i read the other reviews of this to see if i‚Äôm crazy and even the ones who also think it was boring said the cinematography and music were good but i didnt even love either of those,3

2020-08-16,"I really don't understand the hype with this one. This movie had nothing at all to say about anything (maybe there's some confused message about capitalism somewhere? Not likely though) and I have no idea why it was made other than to force an audience to watch some cool detached guy be cool and detached for an hour and a half, occasionally bursting into random moments of rage and violence that were supposed to feel semi-justified but actually just felt‚Ä¶",3
2020-08-09,"This movie frustrates the shit out of me. It‚Äôs poorly structured, the pacing is dreadful, and you‚Äôre not given any proper reason to care about any of the characters, making it a chore in itself to even give a shit about what‚Äôs happening plot-wise. Everyone feels so bland. It‚Äôs an absolute bore. The long, drawn-out shots of nothing happening doesn‚Äôt do anything for the film‚Äôs aesthetic. The entire movie feels like a whole lot of nothing.

2020-08-08,"i feel like ryan gosling's character was pulled in a million different directions throughout the plot, the song choices were also blah, there also wasn't a whole lot of driving and by the end i was unsure what story they were trying to tell, i did kinda like the ending tho",3

,Really didn't like this movie. Gosling's deadpan acting made me think that this was an unintentional Yorgos Lanthanimos movie. I was so bored and put to sleep by the slow and cliche dialogue that I laughed at the parts when someone would get slapped in the face or when there would be a scene with overly ridiculous bloody violence. I really didn't see any part of this movie that had any unique flavor (other than the slow-toned pace which I don't see a real necessity for) and I really don't get the hype for it.,3
2020-08-05,"The character development was so poor that I couldn't even feel the slightest bit sympathetic for ""Driver"" at any point in the film. Honestly, I wouldn't have even cared if he died. This movie made no sense.",3

2020-07-28,Absolute fucking horseshit. The fact that it has a 4 average rating is egregious and laughable. Everyone who gave it over 3 stars needs to be tested for methamphetamines. The only saving grace of this movie was a good sound track.,3

2020-07-21,why did they make this movie?,3
2020-07-16,This was such a let down. The beginning of the film wasted so much time trying to look cool or create this aesthetic without establishing a strong story line/first act. There were a few cool action sequences but I wanted this film to have me on edge. All the female characters felt like throwaways and especially with Carey Mulligans talent she should of been utilized a lot more.,3
2020-07-10,"Good plot line and alright choice of cast to play each character. I just don‚Äôt feel like this the right role for Ryan Gosling, every movie he is the lead in his portrayed character never shuts the fuck up and he barely speaks in this one. Movie also switches genres quite often from love story to action thriller to drama and back to love story. The climax is too long and dragged out and very predictable.",3
2020-07-06,"Weird and disturbing. I thought I would love it with the opening driving scene, but it was all downhill from there.

2020-04-22,"Not a good film. Ryan Gosling's character was so shallow and undeveloped that it hurt. Every scene he was in was so painfully awkward and hard to watch. The acting as a whole wasn't anything to behold at all, with the exception of Ron Perlman. He is the only one who did at least average in my opinion.

,An awareness raising film about an autistic man obsessed with cars who develops a romantic interest in his next door neighbour. His obsession with cars makes it difficult for him to relate to his love interest in a normal way.
